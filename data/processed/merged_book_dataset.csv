Doomsday Men,P. D. Smith,1429984864,9781429984867,2024,Macmillan + ORM,588,4.5,2,"The gripping, untold story of the doomsday bomb—the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. ""Chillingly compelling."" — New Scientist In 1950, Hungarian-born scientist Leo Szilard made a dramatic announcement on American radio: science was on the verge of creating a doomsday bomb. For the first time in history, mankind realized that he had within his grasp a truly God-like power, the ability to destroy life itself. The shockwave from this statement reverberated across the following decade and beyond. If detonated, Szilard's doomsday device—a huge cobalt-clad H-bomb—would pollute the atmosphere with radioactivity and end all life on earth. The scientific creators of such apocalyptic weapons had transformed the laws of nature into instruments of mass destruction and for many people in the Cold War there was little to distinguish real scientists from that ""fictional master of megadeath,"" Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Indeed, as P. D. Smith's chilling account, Doomsday Men, shows, the dream of the superweapon begins in popular culture. This is a story that cannot be told without the iconic films and fictions that portray our deadly fascination with superweapons, from H.G. Wells's The War of the Worlds to Nevil Shute's On the Beach and Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Although scientists admitted it was possible to build the cobalt bomb, no superpower would admit to having created one. However, it remained a terrifying possibility, striking fear into the hearts of people around the world. The story of the cobalt bomb is an unwritten chapter of the Cold War, but now P. D. Smith reveals the personalities behind this feared technology and shows how the scientists responsible for the twentieth century's most terrible weapons grew up in a culture dreaming of superweapons and Wellsian utopias. He argues that, in the end, the doomsday machine became the ultimate symbol of humanity's deepest fears about the science of destruction. ""Weaving together biography, science and art, Smith has created a compelling history of physics in the twentieth century, focusing on the long-lasting search for ever more destructive weapons—from the development of chemical warfare in World War I Germany through the arms race of the Cold War. . . . Captivating and thoroughly referenced, this chronicle should interest a wide audience, from science and history buffs to armchair politicos."" — Publishers Weekly",['History'],"['New Release', 'History']",new_releases,isOmR5YkpIEC,,0,,[],4.944

For the last century, the tastes and preferences of the common reader have been reflected in the American and British bestseller lists, and this Very Short Introduction takes an engaging look through the lists to reveal what we have been reading - and why. John Sutherland shows that bestseller lists monitor one of the strongest pulses in modern literature and are therefore worthy of serious study. Along the way, he lifts the lid on the bestseller industry, examines what makes a book into a bestseller, and asks what separates bestsellers from canonical fiction. Exploring the relationship between bestsellers and the fashions, ideologies, and cultural concerns of the day, the book includes short case-studies and lively summaries of bestsellers through the years: from In His Steps - now almost totally forgotten, but the biggest all-time bestseller between 1895 and 1945, to Gone with the Wind and The Andromeda Strain, and The Da Vinci Code.

A past kiss with adorably bookish Miss Olivia Norley should be barely a memory for Marlowe Drake, the Duke of Thornstock. After all, there are countless debutantes for a handsome rakehell to charm beyond a young lady whose singular passion is chemistry—of the laboratory type.

Now Thorn’s half-brother, Grey, has hired the brilliant Miss Norley for her scientific expertise in solving a troubling family mystery. And the once-burned Thorn, suspicious of her true motives, vows to follow her every move . . . For Olivia, determining whether arsenic poisoning killed Grey’s father is the pioneering experiment that could make her career—and Thorn’s constant presence is merely a distraction. But someone has explosive plans to derail her search. Soon the most unexpected discovery is the caring nature of the reputed scoundrel beside her—and the electricity it ignites between them . . . “Intoxicating…Jeffries’s perfect blend of romance, mystery, and suspense is sure to have series readers anxious for more.” —Publishers Weekly",['Fiction'],"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Fiction']",romance,cxPFDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],3.466

As we read, we discover and explore the dream-sea Quiddity and the islands of Ephemeris; the five Dominions of the Imajica, of which the Earth is but an imperfect facet; the rapturous world woven into an ancient, threadbare carpet in a derelict house in Liverpool; Hood's Holiday House where each day contains four seasons and children's wishes may come true; the Sky Room of Galilee, where the creation of the universe may be witnessed; and the clubs and bars of San Francisco and New York, in which all manner of sexual adventures lie in wait. In these stories, the real and the miraculous are within a breath of one another, life gives way to death, and death to life; doorways open into other states of existence, and each doorway leads us back to our own dreams and fears. The Essential Clive Barker is an irresistible narrative compendium that superbly represents the impressive quality and range of Barker's fiction, spanning more than twenty years of writing.

The Delaney family love one another dearly—it’s just that sometimes they want to murder each other . . . If your mother was missing, would you tell the police? Even if the most obvious suspect was your father? This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings. The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable? The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon. One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted. Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.",['Fiction'],"['Suspense', 'Thriller', 'Fiction']",suspense,KWUMEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],3.296

The Monterey Peninsula is rocked when a killer begins to leave roadside crosses beside local highways—not in memoriam, but as announcements of his intention to kill. And to kill in particularly horrific and efficient ways: using the personal details about the victims that they've carelessly posted in blogs and on social networking websites. The case lands on the desk of Kathryn Dance, the California Bureau of Investigation's foremost kinesics—body language-expert. She and Deputy Michael O'Neil follow the leads to Travis Brigham, a troubled teenager whose role in a fatal car accident has inspired vicious attacks against him on a popular blog, The Chilton Report.

Using techniques he learned as a brilliant participant in MMORPGs—Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games—he easily eludes his pursuers and continues to track his victims, some of whom Kathryn is able to save, some not. Among the obstacles Kathryn must hurdle are politicians from Sacramento, paranoid parents, and the blogger himself, James Chilton, whose belief in the importance of blogging and the new media threatens to derail the case and potentially Dance's career. It is this threat that causes Dance to take desperate and risky measures...

The Institute,Stephen King,1982110597,9781982110598,2019,Simon and Schuster,576,2.5,2,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King whose “storytelling transcends genre” (Newsday) comes “another winner: creepy and touching and horrifyingly believable” (The Boston Globe) about a group of kids confronting evil. In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.” In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute. As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is “first-rate entertainment that has something important to say. We all need to listen” (The Washington Post).",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,iSKGDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],2.747

Ruth Butterham is young, poor, and awaiting trial for murder. When Dorothea's charitable work brings her to Oakgate Prison, she is delighted by the chance to explore her fascination with phrenology and test her hypothesis that the shape of a person's skull can cast a light on their darkest crimes. But when she meets one of the prisoners, the teenaged seamstress Ruth, she is faced with another strange idea: that it is possible to kill with a needle and thread--because Ruth attributes her crimes to a supernatural power inherent in her stitches. The story Ruth has to tell of her deadly creations—of bitterness and betrayal, of death and dresses—will shake Dorothea's belief in rationality, and the power of redemption. Can Ruth be trusted? Is she mad, or a murderer?

In 1930s Cleveland, a serial killer nicknamed the Torso Killer went on a horrific spree that resulted in more than a dozen murders. And he was never caught. Today, forensic scientist Theresa MacLean is called to an abandoned building where a body has been found in a room that's been sealed off for years. Although there's no immediate proof, everyone assumes the newly discovered corpse was a Torso Killer victim. But then another body—this one recently deceased—turns up, and all signs seem to indicate the work of a new Torso Killer.

But as the body count rises, danger closes in on Theresa. For the killer is keeping a watchful eye on Theresa, and each step brings them closer and closer to each other. . . .

The American Police Novel,Leroy Lad Panek,0786481374,9780786481378,2015,McFarland,304,2.0,1,"The American police novel emerged soon after World War II and by the end of the century it was one of the most important forms of American crime fiction. The vogue for either Holmesian genius or the plucky amateur detective dominated mystery fiction until mid-century; the police hero offered a way to make the traditional mystery story contemporary. The police novel reflects sociology and history, and addresses issues tied to the police force, such as corruption, management, and brutality. Since the police novel reflects current events, the changing natures of crime, court procedures, and legislation have an impact on its plots and messages. An examination of the police novel covers both the evolution of a genre of fiction and American culture in general. This work traces the emergence of the police officer as hero and the police novel as a significant popular genre, from the cameo appearances of police in detective novels of the 1930s and 1940s through the serial killer and forensic novels of the 1990s. It follows the ways in which professional writers and police officers turned writers view the police individually and collectively. The work chronicles the ways in which changes in the law and society have affected the actions of the police and shows how the protagonists of police novels have changed in gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, and age over the years. The major writers examined begin with Julian Hawthorne in the nineteenth century, and include such writers as S.S. van Dine, Ellery Queen, Erle Stanley Gardner, Ed McBain, Chester Himes, MacKinley Kantor, Hillary Waugh, Dorothy Uhnak, Joseph Wambaugh, Bob Leuci, W.E.B.

As this book points out, such fiction reveals the lesbian's increasing visibility in the wider society. Nevertheless, it can still be difficult to find a complete representation of lesbian life in mainstream literature. Often the best place to find the lesbian represented in books is within the pages of genre fiction--especially the detective story. This book looks at how the lesbian characters' public and private lives intersect--often at the point of coming out, or of moving from isolation to connection with the community. Also considered is the lesbian detective's typical confrontation with two crucial elements of the investigator's role: the use of violence and the acquisition and expression of authority within police systems. Other topics of discussion include the cultural environments in which the stories are situated, and the use of humor as a key weapon in the lesbian detective's investigative arsenal.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Literary Criticism']",mystery_additional,b4JPWsF-p4IC,,0,,[],0.693
Suspect,Scott Turow,1538706350,9781538706350,2022,Grand Central Publishing,378,1.0,1,"The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Presumed Innocent and The Last Trial returns with a riveting legal thriller in which a reckless private detective is embroiled in a fraught police scandal. For as long as Lucia Gomez has been the police chief in the city of Highland Isle, near Kindle County, she has known that any woman in law enforcement must walk a precarious line between authority and camaraderie to gain respect. She has maintained a spotless reputation—until now. Three male police officers have accused her of soliciting sex in exchange for promotions to higher ranks. With few people left who she can trust, Chief Gomez turns to an old friend, Rik Dudek, to act as her attorney in the federal grand jury investigation, insisting to Rik that the accusations against her are part of an ugly smear campaign designed to destroy her career and empower her enemies—both outside the police force and within.. Clarice “Pinky” Granum spent most of her youth experimenting with an impressive array of drugs and failing out of various professions, including the police academy. Pinky knows that in the eyes of most people, she's nothing but a screwup—but she doesn't trust most people's opinions anyway. Moreover, she finally has a respectable-enough job as a licensed P.I. working for Rik on his roster of mostly minor cases, like workman's comp, DUIs and bar fights. Rik's shabby office and even shabbier cases are a far cry from the kinds of high-profile criminal matters Pinky became familiar with in the law office of her grandfather, Sandy Stern.

Reading the Cozy Mystery,Phyllis M. Betz,1476641692,9781476641690,2021,McFarland,237,0.0,0,"With their intimate settings, subdued action and likeable characters, cozy mysteries are rarely seen as anything more than light entertainment. The cozy, a subgenre of crime fiction, has been historically misunderstood and often overlooked as the subject of serious study. This anthology brings together a groundbreaking collection of essays that examine the cozy mystery from a range of critical viewpoints. The authors engage with the standard classification of a cozy, the characters who appear in its pages, the environment where the crime occurs and how these elements reveal the cozy story's complexity in surprising ways. Essays analyze cozy mysteries to argue that Agatha Christie is actually not a cozy writer; that Columbo fits the mold of the cozy detective; and that the stories' portrayals of settings like the quaint English village reveal a more complicated society than meets the eye.",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,hEsgEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

First comes the murder of Bethany Grable, owner of The Painted Lotus art gallery and old friend of Father Tom. Dan’s convinced she was the victim of a robbery gone wrong. Father Tom, on the other hand, is not so sure. Then comes the wave of overdose deaths of young students at Myer College. Someone is selling fentanyl at prices college kids can afford. They’re all art majors, and all of them happen to have had pieces displayed in Bethany’s gallery. Coincidence? Or is there a connection between the ODs and Bethany Grable’s murder? And if so, what is the connection? Father Tom decides to try to find out for himself who killed his old friend and why.

Along the way, Father Tom learns that Helen wasn’t the only person wounded in that basement . . .

June 1815. The people of London wait breathlessly for news as Napoléon and the forces united against him hurtle toward their final reckoning at Waterloo. Among them is Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, frustrated to find himself sidelined while recovering from a dangerous wound he recently received in Paris. When the mutilated corpse of Major Miles Sedgewick surfaces from the murky waters of the Thames, Sebastian is drawn into the murder investigation, which threatens one of his oldest and dearest friends, Irish surgeon Paul Gibson. Gibson’s lover, Alexi Sauvage, was tricked into a bigamous marriage with the victim. But there are other women who may have wanted the cruel, faithless major dead. His mistress, his neglected wife, and their young governess whom he seduced all make for compelling suspects. Even more interesting to Sebastian is one of Sedgewick’s fellow officers, a man who shared Sedgewick’s macabre interest in both old English folklore and the occult. And then there’s the valuable list of Londoners who once spied for Napoléon that Sedgewick was said to be transporting to Charles, Lord Jarvis, the Regent’s powerful cousin, who also happens to be Sebastian’s own father-in-law. The deeper Sebastian delves into Sedgewick’s life, the more he learns about the Major’s many secrets, and the list of people who could have wanted him dead grows even longer. Soon others connected to Sedgewick begin to die strange, brutal deaths, and more evidence emerges that links Alexi to the crimes. Certain that Gibson will be implicated alongside his lover, Sebastian finds himself in a desperate race against time to stop the killings and save his friends from the terror of the gallows.",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,cgLhEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Imposter is the eighth book in the Ash Park series, though all novels in the Ash Park world can be read as standalones. A kidnapped child. A detective on the edge. And a suicide that’s anything but. “Little Greggie” Boyle was the amazing reappearing child—a boy kidnapped and returned to his parents after five years in captivity. So what would make him take his own life? That’s the question hanging over Detective Petrosky’s head. It seems straightforward: the teenager was found suspended from the rafters in the foyer of his parents’ home, a rope around his neck. No signs of struggle. No note, though that isn’t uncommon despite what Hollywood says—those movie nitwits don’t know real crime from their left elbows. But something is wrong. The victim’s parents are stonewalling the police, and Gregory’s brother is cagey—even a little creepy. None of them seem interested in finding out what drove Gregory to kill himself. Or maybe they know something Petrosky doesn’t. Then forensic evidence turns the case on its head: the boy was drugged. The death wasn’t a suicide at all. Perhaps the kidnappers came back to make sure he stayed quiet…permanently. As the investigation continues, a darker pattern of abductions begins to emerge. Gregory wasn’t the only child taken, and it appears the kidnapper is cleaning house—are any of the other victims still alive? One thing seems clear: Petrosky and his partner aren’t just hunting a killer; they’re looking for more bodies. If they don’t hurry, the man who murdered Gregory Boyle will rip other children from their families—kids who will never again come home. And more dead children, especially on the anniversary of his daughter’s grisly murder, is more than Detective Petrosky can handle. He needs to catch the killer and ensure no more children fall prey to this maniac before he loses his own tenuous grasp on sanity. ​​​​​​​""A chilling and intricate web… spectacularly entertaining.” ~Bestselling Author Kristen Mae ""Dark and twisty... a masterful procedural that explores identity and family secrets, Imposter is as surprising as it is addictive.

Fans of Melinda Leigh, Teresa Driscoll, and Carolyn Kepnes will love The Flood. Seven people. A locked storm shelter. Inevitable starvation. What could you do to survive? Victoria Larson and her husband, Chad, are sitting on their rooftop, waiting for the end. For three days, they’ve watched their coastal Louisiana town turn into a lake, battered by an unprecedented series of hurricanes. With the levees obliterated, the waters rise higher and higher—the next storm is sure to swallow their house whole. Just when all hope seems lost, a rescue boat emerges through the driving rain; a woman named Windy plucks them from their roof and motors them to a waterproof bunker—to safety. There, with a ragtag group of other evacuees, Victoria and Chad bed down and prepare to wait out the storms. But it isn’t long before Victoria notices a few things seem…off. The concrete bunker has a door that locks from the outside. Many of the boxes of food don’t contain food at all. The bottles of water smell like rubbing alcohol. And everyone in the group has a secret; even Victoria’s own estranged husband seems to have known their captor prior to making the trek to the shelter. And some of her fellow evacuees are far too intent on defending the woman who locked them in this dungeon. Are they really storm victims like Victoria? Or are they accomplices in a sick game? One thing is certain: none of them will survive if they can’t find something to eat. And if the stories the others tell about Windy are any indication, Victoria suspects their captor’s plans are far more evil than simply watching them die of malnourishment. The blade Windy gave her is proof enough of that. And it won’t be long until starvation devours the last of Victoria’s sanity. “Intense. Feral.

Dame Agatha Christie reigns supreme as the Queen of Crime. Numerous books have been written about the legendary crime writer, focusing on nearly every aspect of her craft. But until now no one has carried out an in-depth investigation into how she conquered the serial market with her thrilling tales of murder and intrigue. In the UK and US, Agatha Christies work was serialized in the most prestigious magazines and newspapers of the day, often under an array of different titles, prior to being published by Collins and Dodd, Mead and Company. Second serial rights could result in a single title being syndicated to over 40 newspapers. Over the decades, numerous records have been lost or destroyed and keeping track of her literary legacy has proved a major challenge for her publishers, literary agents and others until now. Jared Cade, author of the ground-breaking biography Agatha Christie and the Eleven Missing Days, has unearthed a huge plethora of hitherto unknown facts about the timeline of her publishing history that will delight her devotees and enable future generations to write about her work with far greater authority and accuracy than ever before, especially when correlating her publications to the parallels in her life. Illustrated with rare pictures, Secrets from the Agatha Christie Archives is destined to become an essential reference tool for fans, librarians, scholars, antiquarian booksellers, broadcasters and others interested in the making of one of the 20th century's most beloved writers. Jared Cade is an acknowledged authority on Christianna  Crime Time",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,P3s-EQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Rather, the majority of scholarship examines the depiction of Native characters from the perspective of non-Native authors. Native American Mystery Writing: Indigenous Investigations analyzes how Native authors use the genre to foreground centuries of settler-colonial crimes and comment upon the ways in which these acts continue to impact Native individuals and communities today. Considering fourteen novels and two made-for-TV films, this book surveys a spectrum of settler-colonial crimes: the Osage oil murders, sexual assault against Native women, missing and murdered Indigenous women, the California mission system, suppression of spiritual beliefs, theft—of land, children, and cultural items—and, of course, murder. Examination of these texts shows how Native authors working with the mystery, crime, and detective fiction formats are able to entertain readers while also sending strong social, cultural, and political messages that argue for strengthened tribal sovereignty and illustrate the resilience of Indigenous peoples—all in order to promote discussions about creating a more just system for Native Nations.",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,unWODwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

I loved this book.”—Gabrielle Zevin, author of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow “I fell in love with the fascinating, brilliant family at the center of this riveting book.”—Ann Napolitano, author of Hello Beautiful “We didn’t call the police right away.” Those are the electric first words of this extraordinary novel about a biracial Korean American family in Virginia whose lives are upended when their beloved father and husband goes missing. Mia, the irreverent, hyperanalytical twenty-year-old daughter, has an explanation for everything—which is why she isn’t initially concerned when her father and younger brother Eugene don’t return from a walk in a nearby park. They must have lost their phone. Or stopped for an errand somewhere. But by the time Mia’s brother runs through the front door bloody and alone, it becomes clear that the father in this tight-knit family is missing and the only witness is Eugene, who has the rare genetic condition Angelman syndrome and cannot speak. What follows is both a ticking-clock investigation into the whereabouts of a father and an emotionally rich portrait of a family whose most personal secrets just may be at the heart of his disappearance. Full of shocking twists and fascinating questions of love, language, and human connection, Happiness Falls is a mystery, a family drama, and a novel of profound philosophical inquiry.

Praise for Berkeley Noir ""Each story evokes the dark side of a Berkeley neighborhood and pays tribute both to the city's history as a haven for outcasts and as a literary metropolis. If you race through it, consider picking up San Francisco Noir and Oakland Noir."" — Diablo Magazine, a Top Ticket choice ""In ""Lucky Day,"" Thomas Burchfield reveals the evil that can come when a well-meaning aide breaks his boss's cardinal rule never to allow patrons into the library early. A worried mom from Holloway wangles her son a prized place in the Berkeley school district in Aya de León's ""Frederick Douglass Elementary."" . . . . J.M. Curet's ""Wifebeater Tank Top,"" the tale with the firmest criminal pedigree, is the most violent, but its poetic language and come-from-nowhere ending make it the best."" — Kirkus Reviews ""The 16 stories set in Berkeley, Calif., in this above average Akashic noir anthology offer little actual noir but a heaping helping of crime, with almost every entry featuring at least a murder or kidnapping . . . . Readers will be glad that many of these tales are fun in a way that traditional noir isn't."" — Publishers Weekly",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,UpGyDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Now, the time has come. Diana never forgot her first boyfriend, who begged her to join him for a year in Europe after college.

But now, with her daughters grown, her husband gone, and her career no longer fulfilling, Diana realizes it’s time for herself—and to take that romantic year in Europe she’d always dreamed of. Diana prepares to embark on the year of her life, finally turning to her bucket list, hoping to tour the most beautiful sights and sample the most scrumptious cuisines—and maybe, even, to fall in love again. But a year in Europe may have different plans in store for her. Can A-type Diana learn to go with the flow, to be spontaneous, to let down her guard and to learn to truly enjoy life again? In DEATH IN FLORENCE (Book #2), Diana arrives in Florence, ready to shake off the events of Paris and fulfill her lifelong dream of being proposed to on the romantic Ponte Vecchio bridge.

Like other beloved British imports, this series piqued Americans' interest with hints of dark comedy, clever plotlines, and six-episode seasons that left audiences frantic for more. In Transatlantic Television Drama, volume editors Michele Hilmes, Matt Hills, and Roberta Pearson team up with leading scholars in TV studies and transnational television to look at how serial dramas like Black Mirror captivate US audiences, and what this reveals about the ways Americans and Brits relate to each other on and off the screen. Focusing on production strategies, performance styles, and audience reception, chapters delve into some of the most widely-discussed programs on the transatlantic circuit, from ongoing series like Game of Thrones, Downton Abbey, Orphan Black, and Sherlock, to those with long histories of transnational circulation like Masterpiece and Doctor Who, to others whose transnational success speaks to the process of exchange, adaptation, and cooperation such as Rome, Parade's End, Broadchurch, and Gracepoint. The book's first section investigates the platforms that support British/American exchange, from distribution partnerships and satellite providers to streaming services. The second section concentrates on the shift in meaning across cultural contexts, such as invocations of heritage, genre shifts in adaptation, performance styles, and, in the case of Episodes, actual dramatized depiction of the process of transatlantic television production. In section three, attention turns to contexts of audience reception, ranging from fan conventions and fiction to television criticism, the effects of national branding on audiences, and the role of social media in de- or re-contextualizing fans' response to transnational programs.",['Performing Arts'],['Mystery'],mystery,vdB2DwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

From 1965 to the present, both Scandinavian and French societies have undergone significant transformations. Twelve literary case studies examine how crime fictions in the respective contexts have responded to shifting social realities, which have in turn played a part in transforming the generic codes and conventions of the crime novel. At the centre of the book’s analysis is crime fiction’s negotiation of the French model of Republican universalism and the Scandinavian welfare state, both of which were routinely characterised as being in a state of crisis at the end of the twentieth century. Adopting a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, the book investigates the interplay between contemporary Scandinavian and French crime narratives, considering their engagement with the relationship of the state and the citizen, and notably with identity issues (class, gender, sexuality and ethnicity in particular).",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,hwc0EAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Light in the Dark,Bjö Norðfjörð,019776214X,9780197762141,2025,Oxford University Press,281,0.0,0,"Light in the Dark tells the dramatic history of Icelandic cinema from its modest origin in the early twentieth century to the heterogenous and complex national cinema of today. In tracing this wide-ranging history, author Björn Norðfjörð describes the constant tug between local and national cultural forces and the transnational and global pull of world cinema. Norðfjörð starts by casting light on the earliest films made in the country, expanding outward to survey Scandinavians adaptations of Icelandic literature filmed during the late silent period, documentaries of the interwar period, and the first narrative features following the end of World War II and national independence. He traces the emergence of national cinema proper to the 1980s, with the foundation of the Icelandic Film Fund, explores the subsequent impact of first European art cinema and then Hollywood genre cinema, and finally considers the remarkable international success of Icelandic cinema in the twentieth-first century. Along the way, Norðfjörð draws attention to many additional issues and topics regarding Icelandic cinema, including depictions of nature and animals, the aesthetics of fire and ice, the role of film adaptation, the impact of Nordic noir and crime fiction, Hollywood runaway productions, and the question of women's cinema in Icelandic filmmaking. Throughout the book, films from all periods of Icelandic filmmaking are analysed in detail with equal emphasis on content and form, including both lesser known titles and key films like The Outlaw and His Wife (Victor Sjöström, 1917), Salka Valka (Arne Mattson, 1954), Land and Sons (Ágúst Guðmundsson, 1980), When the Raven Flies (Hrafn Gunnlaugsson, 1984), Cold Fever (Friðrik Þór Friðriksson, 1995), 101 Reykjavík (Baltasar Kormákur), Rams (Grímur Hákonarson, 2015) and Godland (Hlynur Pálmason, 2022).",['History'],['Mystery'],mystery,PftBEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

They provide in-depth assessments of the breadth and achievement of novelists and short story writers whose collective contribution to the evolution and modification of these unique art forms has been far out of proportion to Ireland's small size. The volume brings a variety of critical perspectives to bear on the development of modern Irish fiction, situating authors, texts, and genres in their social, intellectual, and literary historical contexts. The Handbook's coverage encompasses an expansive range of topics, including the recalcitrant atavisms of Irish Gothic fiction; nineteenth-century Irish women's fiction and its influence on emergent modernism and cultural nationalism; the diverse modes of irony, fabulism, and social realism that characterize the fiction of the Irish Literary Revival; the fearless aesthetic radicalism of James Joyce; the jolting narratological experiments of Samuel Beckett, Flann O'Brien, and Máirtín Ó Cadhain; the fate of the realist and modernist traditions in the work of Elizabeth Bowen, Frank O'Connor, Seán O'Faoláin, and Mary Lavin, and in that of their ambivalent heirs, Edna O'Brien, John McGahern, and John Banville; the subversive treatment of sexuality and gender in Northern Irish women's fiction written during and after the Troubles; the often neglected genres of Irish crime fiction, science fiction, and fiction for children; the many-hued novelistic responses to the experiences of famine, revolution, and emigration; and the variety and vibrancy of post-millennial fiction from both parts of Ireland.

Lockdown Cultures,"Stella Bruzzi, Maurice Biriotti",1800083394,9781800083394,2022,UCL Press,346,0.0,0,"Lockdown Cultures is both a cultural response to our extraordinary times and a manifesto for the arts and humanities and their role in our post-pandemic society. This book offers a unique response to the question of how the humanities commented on and were impacted by one of the dominant crises of our times: the Covid-19 pandemic. While the role of engineers, epidemiologists and, of course, medics is assumed, Lockdown Cultures illustrates some of the ways in which the humanities understood and analysed 2020–21, the year of lockdown and plague. Though the impulse behind the book was topical, underpinning the richly varied and individual essays is a lasting concern with the value of the humanities in the twenty-first century. Each contributor approaches this differently but there are two dominant strands: how art and culture can help us understand the Covid crisis; and how the value of the humanities can be demonstrated by engaging with cultural products from the past. The result is a book that serves as testament to the humanities’ reinvigorated and reforged sense of identity, from the perspective of UCL and one of the leading arts and humanities faculties in the world. It bears witness to a globally impactful event while showcasing interdisciplinary thinking and examining how the pandemic has changed how we read, watch, write and educate.

Even though I work for a top-secret agency, I’ve never been in an exciting car chase, sipped a stirred (not shaken) martini, or shot a poison dart from an umbrella. Until today, that is, when two gun-toting thugs popped up in my life and my best friend disappeared. So, I’ve enlisted the help of the Zimmerman twins—the reclusive architects of America’s most sensitive electronic networks—to help me navigate a bewildering maze of leads to find her.

These essays address topics such as the array of competing nationalisms in Europe; Indian secularism versus Hindu communalism; the populist rhetoric tinged with misogyny or homophobia in the United States; racial, religious or ethnic others who are sidelined in political appeals to dominant native voices; and the increasing economic chasm between a rich and poor. More broadly, these essays inquire into themes such as how national identity and various conceptions of masculinity are woven together, how dominant native cultures interact with migrant and colonized cultures to explore insider/outsider paradigms and identity politics, and how generic and cultural boundaries are repeatedly crossed in postcolonial detective fiction.",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,tZHiDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

ARTHUR B. REEVE Ultimate Collection: 11 Thriller Novels & 49 Detective Stories,Arthur B. Reeve,,,2023,Good Press,2933,0.0,0,"Arthur B. Reeve's ""Ultimate Collection: 11 Thriller Novels & 49 Detective Stories"" stands as a monumental anthology that encapsulates the author's incisive exploration of the mysteries of human behavior through the lens of early 20th-century crime fiction. Renowned for his vivid storytelling and innovative integration of scientific principles into narrative, Reeve's work is characterized by his creation of the iconic detective, Craig Kennedy, whose adventures intertwine criminology, psychology, and cutting-edge technology of the time. This collection not only serves as a testament to the Golden Age of detective fiction but also illuminates societal anxieties surrounding crime and morality in post-Victorian America. Arthur B. Reeve, an American author born in 1880, was deeply influenced by the rapidly evolving technological landscape of his era. His background in journalism, combined with a keen interest in science, equipped him with a unique perspective that he masterfully wove into his thrilling narratives. Reeve's passion for unearthing the intricacies of criminal psychology and forensic science finds its most vibrant expression in this extensive collection, reflecting the zeitgeist of an age where the boundaries of science and mystery began to blur. This anthology is highly recommended for readers who appreciate intricately plotted thrillers laden with intellectual depth and social commentary. Reeve's work not only entertains but also invites critical reflection on the nature of truth, justice, and the human psyche, making it an indispensable resource for both enthusiasts of the genre and scholars interested in the evolution of crime fiction.",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,kRPmEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Contemporary Chinese Novels in Translation since 1978,Yun Wu,1040153593,9781040153598,2024,Taylor & Francis,194,0.0,0,"This book aims to complement the traditional focus of translation studies, which has primarily centered on translating English into other languages. It presents a comprehensive analysis of the reverse translation trajectory, exploring the movement of Chinese literature into the core English literary domain. The book aims to explore the ideological and sociological dynamics that underlie the translation of contemporary Chinese novels. This is achieved through an examination of the translation selection process, translation paratexts, and the roles of translation agents. Case studies are employed to illustrate specific linguistic, literary, and cultural challenges within translation. It dissects the cultural and literary implications of translating genres such as women's writing, science fiction, and Internet literature. The argument presented is that the translation of peripheral literature is indispensable in shaping global literature. Beyond its literary implications, the book identifies the political significance inherent in such reverse translation endeavors. It suggests that the translation of Chinese literature holds notable political interest for the Chinese government, which aims to reshape China's image and bolster the nation's soft power through literary translation. This work will be an essential read to students and scholars of translation studies, comparative literature, and Chinese studies.",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,jUZHEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Sometimes the answers are worse than the questions. Sometimes it's better not to know. Set in the poorest part of the Missouri Ozarks, in a small town with big secrets, The Familiar Dark opens with a murder. Eve Taggert, desperate with grief over losing her daughter, takes it upon herself to find out the truth about what happened. Eve is no stranger to the dark side of life, having been raised by a hard-edged mother whose lessons Eve tried not to pass on to her own daughter. But Eve may need her mother's cruel brand of strength if she's going to face the reality about her daughter's death and about her own true nature. Her quest for justice takes her from the seedy underbelly of town to the quiet woods and, most frighteningly, back to her mother's trailer for a final lesson. The Familiar Dark is a story about the bonds of family—women doing the best they can for their daughters in dire circumstances—as well as a story about how even the darkest and most terrifying of places can provide the comfort of home.",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,7rQlEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The lifeless body of a woman wearing an evening dress is discovered in the party room of the wax museum. Everything would suggest suicide, but DCI Eric Shaw, team chief at the Forensic Services of Scotland Yard who’s investigating the scene with crime scene investigator Adele Pennington, immediately notices a few similarities with the case of a serial killer nicknamed Plastic Surgeon, closed three years ago with the arrest of Robert Graham. Perhaps someone is emulating Graham, or he had an accomplice, but there is a third possibility that especially concerns Eric, who, being convinced of Graham’s guilt, tampered with the physical evidence to ensure his conviction. What if he made a mistake and sent the wrong person to jail? After eleven months, and despite her reluctance, he once again finds himself working with DI Miriam Leroux from the Murder Investigation Teams. Now they have to race against time to follow the trail of the elusive murderer. This is possibly Shaw’s final major case before a promotion to superintendent. The other contender for advancement being DCI George Jankowski, a man who is not afraid to weed out the dirty secrets of others to get what he wants. And Eric and his pupil hide an unspeakable secret. The destiny of DCI Eric Shaw is about to be fulfilled. This book is written in British English. The final act of the trilogy. The Detective Eric Shaw Trilogy Set between 2014 and 2017, the Detective Eric Shaw Trilogy has as the main character a detective chief inspector leading a forensic team assisting police detectives in their investigations at Scotland Yard. DCI Shaw is facing a crucial period in his life. Excessive dedication to work caused his marriage to fail and turned him into a cop ready to break more than one rule to satisfy his obsession with bringing criminals to justice. His already precarious balance is undermined by a forensic investigator on his team who is much younger than him, Adele Pennington, for whom he has feelings that he considers inappropriate given the age difference, and by a series of murders on which he investigates together with his god-daughter DI Miriam Leroux. They bear similarities to a 1994 cold case in which Eric himself rescued a seven-year-old girl from a crime scene, the only witness to the massacre of her family. In this psychological crime thriller series, the border between investigation and crime becomes blurred in a story that isn’t only about finding the culprit, but rather observing how the main character decides to react to his shocking findings. In a dark game of deception and suspense, the reader will be thrown into modern-day London and will end up wondering where the line between good and evil, justice and revenge really is. The trilogy includes the following novels: 1) The Mentor; 2) Syndrome; 3) Beyond the Limit.",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,OPGiEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

China Mysteries,Jeffrey C. Kinkley,0824896734,9780824896737,2023,University of Hawaii Press,224,0.0,0,"With the 1989 Beijing massacre fading from popular memory in the West, China from the mid-1990s to a few years ago felt more open than ever to global trade, communication, travel, and cultural and educational exchanges. There was even talk in the mainstream press that China was heading toward a more democratic future. It was during this second Sino-Western honeymoon that authors in the US, Canada, France, the UK, and elsewhere began writing mystery fiction set in contemporary China in their regional languages. These “China mysteries”—crime, detective, and mystery thriller novels that take place in China but were not written or published there—formed a new genre of popular fiction that highlighted the world’s hopes and fears after Tiananmen. The multinational and multicultural writers of China mysteries, among them ex-PRC nationals like Qiu Xiaolong, Zhang Xinxin, and Diane Wei Liang, converged on the China Mainland to negotiate political and cultural complexities through crime fiction plotlines. Their books emerged from Western lineages of the modern novel and popular genre fiction—with Chinese contributions—and depended on Western commercial publishing models shaped by cultural, national, political, and economic factors. This work examines more than a hundred China mysteries—many describing and analyzing social and economic changes at the center of modern life in China—to provide a brief history of the genre and analyze the formulaic and original elements of the mysteries, including their attention to matters of location, social content, characterization, history, and biography. It also highlights the role of “information” acquisition as a motivation for readers and authors of popular fiction, which has become a topic of discussion in Chinese literature studies. With its timely commentary on Sino-Western relations as presented through crime fiction, China Mysteries will appeal to students and scholars of contemporary Chinese literature and culture, as well as fans of crime novels and others who are curious about the global dimensions of the genre and how it complicates our understanding of “world literature.”",['Literary Criticism'],['Mystery'],mystery,RjjaEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

This period served as a bridge between science-popularization science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s and New Wave Chinese science fiction from the 1990s into the twenty-first century. Chinese Science Fiction during the Post-Mao Cultural Thaw surveys the field of Chinese science fiction and its multimedia practice, analysing and assessing science fiction works by well-known writers such as Ye Yonglie, Zheng Wenguang, Tong Enzheng, and Xiao Jianheng, as well as the often-overlooked tech–science fiction writers of the post-Mao thaw. Exploring the socio-political and cultural dynamics of science-related Chinese literature during this period, Hua Li combines close readings of original Chinese literary texts with literary analysis informed by scholarship on science fiction as a genre, Chinese literary history, and media studies. Li argues that this science fiction of the post-Mao thaw began its rise as a type of government-backed literature, yet it often stirred up controversy and received pushback as a contentious and boundary-breaking genre. Topically structured and interdisciplinary in scope, Chinese Science Fiction during the Post-Mao Cultural Thaw will appeal to both scholars and fans of science fiction.",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,cPIxEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Station Eternity,Mur Lafferty,0593098129,9780593098127,2022,Penguin,465,0.0,0,"Amateur detective Mallory Viridian’s talent for solving murders ruined her life on Earth and drove her to live on an alien space station, but her problems still follow her in this witty, self-aware novel that puts a speculative spin on murder mysteries, from the Hugo-nominated author of Six Wakes. From idyllic small towns to claustrophobic urban landscapes, Mallory Viridian is constantly embroiled in murder cases that only she has the insight to solve. But outside of a classic mystery novel, being surrounded by death doesn’t make you a charming amateur detective, it makes you a suspect and a social pariah. So when Mallory gets the opportunity to take refuge on a sentient space station, she thinks she has the solution. Surely the murders will stop if her only company is alien beings. At first her new existence is peacefully quiet…and markedly devoid of homicide. But when the station agrees to allow additional human guests, Mallory knows the break from her peculiar reality is over. After the first Earth shuttle arrives, and aliens and humans alike begin to die, the station is thrown into peril. Stuck smack-dab in the middle of an extraterrestrial whodunit, and wondering how in the world this keeps happening to her anyway, Mallory has to solve the crime—and fast—or the list of victims could grow to include everyone on board….",['Fiction'],['Mystery'],mystery,ajhYEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

From the introduction by Tayari Jones: Atlanta itself is a crime scene. After all, Georgia was founded as a de facto penal colony and in 1864, Sherman burned the city to the ground. We might argue about whether the arson was the crime or the response to the crime, but this is indisputable: Atlanta is a city sewn from the ashes and everything that grows here is at once fertilized and corrupted by the past . . . These stories do not necessarily conform to the traditional expectations of noir . . . However, they all share the quality of exposing the rot underneath the scent of magnolia and pine. Noir, in my opinion, is more a question of tone than content. The moral universe of the story is as significant as the physical space. Noir is a realm where the good guys seldom win; perhaps they hardly exist at all. Few bad deeds go unrewarded, and good intentions are not the road to hell, but are hell itself . . .

You'll learn about multiple RA approaches, such as genre, appeal features, and reading interests and about essential tools that can help with RA.

British Detective Fiction 1891–1901,Clare Clarke,1137595639,9781137595638,2020,Springer Nature,176,0.0,0,"This book examines the developments in British serial detective fiction which took place in the seven years when Sherlock Holmes was dead. In December 1893, at the height of Sherlock’s popularity with the Strand Magazine’s worldwide readership, Arthur Conan Doyle killed off his detective. At the time, he firmly believed that Holmes would not be resurrected. This book introduces and showcases a range of Sherlock’s most fascinating successors, exploring the ways in which a huge range of popular magazines and newspapers clamoured to ensnare Sherlock’s bereft fans. The book’s case-study format examines a range of detective series-- created by L.T. Meade; C.L. Pirkis; Arthur Morrison; Fergus Hume; Richard Marsh; Kate and Vernon Hesketh-Prichard— that filled the pages of a variety of periodicals, from plush monthly magazines to cheap newspapers, in the years while Sherlock was dead. Readers will be introduced to an array of detectives—professional and amateur, male and female, old and young; among them a pawn-shop worker, a scientist, a British aristocrat, a ghost-hunter. The study of these series shows that there was life after Sherlock and proves that there is much to learn about the development of the detective genre from the successors to Sherlock Holmes. “In this brilliant, incisive study of late Victorian detective fiction, Clarke emphatically shows us there is life beyond Sherlock Holmes. Rich in contextual detail and with her customary eye for the intricacies of publishing history, Clarke’s wonderfully accessible book brings to the fore a collection of hitherto neglected writers simultaneously made possible but pushed to the margins by Conan Doyle’s most famous creation.” — Andrew Pepper,, Senior Lecturer in English and American Literature, Queen's University, Belfast Professor Clarke's superb new book, British Detective : The Successors to Sherlock Holmes, is required reading for anyone interested in Victorian crime and detective fiction. Building on her award-winning first monograph, Late-Victorian Crime Fiction in the Shadows of Sherlock, Dr. Clarke further explores the history of serial detective fiction published after the ""death"" of Conan Doyle's famous detective in 1893. This is a path-breaking book that advances scholarship in the field of late-Victorian detective fiction while at the same time introducing non-specialist readers to a treasure trove of stories that indeed rival the Sherlock Holmes series in their ability to puzzle and entertain the most discerning reader. — Alexis Easley, Professor of English, University of St.Paul, Minnesota",['Fiction'],"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fiction']",mystery_additional,RenwDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Essays reclaim detective fiction as an object of critical inquiry, examining the ways it shapes issues of social destabilization, moral ambiguity, reader complicity, intertextuality, and metafiction. Breaking new ground by moving beyond the critical preoccupation with classification of historical types and generic determinants, contributors examine the effect of mystery on literary forms and on readers, who experience the provocative, complex process of coming to grips with the unknown and the unknowable. This volume opens up discussion on publically acclaimed, modern works of mystery and on classic pieces, addressing a variety of forms including novels, plays, graphic novels, television series, films, and ipad games. Re-examining the interpretive potential of a genre that seems easily defined yet has endless permutations, the book closely analyzes the cultural function of mystery, the way it intervenes in social and political problems, as well as the literary properties that give the genre its particular shape. The volume treats various texts as meaningful subjects for critical analysis and sheds new light on the interpretive potential for a genre that creates as much ambiguity as it does clarity.

A satisfying, gratifying genre for its readership, the detective novel promises the disruption and subsequent restoration of order in societies tarnished by disillusionment which hope for a better future.

Doing what she does best – asking questions – Elizabeth sidesteps her boss and a nosy, jealous anchorman to inquire into an eccentric and mysterious western billionaire, an ambitious curator, rival collectors, family feuds and Cottonwood County's Wild West crimes of a century ago. Digging deeper into these western murder mysteries, Elizabeth relies on her team of friends who are proving their investigative chops. Before this is over, Elizabeth will need every one of them – and the stray dog she's adopted – as her questions push someone to decide that no matter who shot first, Elizabeth should die now. Shoot First continues the much-loved Caught Dead in Wyoming mystery series of twisty whodunnits with humor, a female sleuth to root for, and supporting cast of people you'd like to know. For readers of Jerusha Jones, LT Ryan, AJ Rivers, L.A. Dobbs, D.D. Black, Alex Sigmore, Lyndee Walker, David J. Gatward, Lynda McDaniel, and David Rosenfelt. What readers are saying about SHOOT FIRST: “One of my favorite things in these books is the evolution of the relationship between Elizabeth and the dog. One of the things I liked about this book, particularly, was that it was a bit convoluted. There were a lot of characters who appeared to be the bad guy.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “A witty, character-driven story that made me laugh throughout. . . . I give this book 5 BIG stars and highly recommend it. I can hardly wait for the 4th book in this series.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “E.M. is a character I'd like to meet - multi-talented, likeable, honest, possessing a sense of humor and flawed but not weak. The story was fairly complex with all sorts of twists and turns and misdirection and subterfuge. Just when you think you know who-dun-it you get a surprise and a chance to try again to get it right. I heartily recommend all her books.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Patricia McLinn is one of my new favorite writers. Clean prose, great characters, and maze-like mysteries. Recommended to fans of same.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “MORE. MORE. MORE. OMG..... I hope there will be more books for this series. After reading all three this one was probably the best but all her books and I mean all her books were great reads. You really start to love the characters and don't want it to end.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Best one yet.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Clever, fun characters set in Old West with quick, intelligent wit and plot.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “With each book I've read in this series I've appreciated Ms. McLinn's storytelling abilities more & more. From Shadow to Deputy Shelton & all the great characters in between, each is written with understanding of human nature & heart. I'm hooked & ready for my next Wyoming adventure!” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “This is the third of this series I have read… within one week! Fascinating, intriguing, and the twist that one wants in a good mystery. I’m a new fan, but I think I’ll be a long term one.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Now off to read the fourth book in the series . . . I finished this book in three days' time (and I work full-time!), so maybe I should also buy book five now since it's Friday and I plan on reading and relaxing this weekend. Elizabeth and her friends are definitely entertaining and I'm curious to see what happens next!” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Don't miss Elizabeth’s adventures in western crime-solving with a dash of humor: Sign Off Left Hanging Shoot First Last Ditch Look Live Back Story Cold Open Hot Roll Reaction Shot Body Brace Cross Talk Air Ready Holiday Bullets Cue Up What readers say about the Caught Dead in Wyoming series: ""McLinn has created in E.M. a female protagonist who is flawed but likable, never silly or cartoonish, and definitely not made of cardboard."" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""I love the whole series ‘Caught Dead in Wyoming.’ The writing is witty and sharp; the story is gripping; and the characters are so realistic. . . What I didn't expect was a renewed appreciation given by this ‘inside’ view of the world of journalism. . . . E.M. Danniher changes her community and certain individuals – for the better – due to her dogged pursuit of truth and justice."" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “A fun and edge-of-your-seat thriller in every book.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “The adventures keep getting better and better. Reading this series is involving from the get go.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""I confess to being addicted to this series and characters. I LIKE them. I wish they were real."" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""E.M.'s internal monologues are sharp, snappy and often hilarious."" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""A terrific series with a western flair. . . .

Shapiro once worried that selling 16 books in varied sub-sections made her a literary dabbler. Yet after helping her students publish many award-winning bestsellers on all shelves of the bookstore, she realized that her versatility had a huge upside. She could explain, from personal experience, the differences in making each kind of book, as well as ways to find the right genre for every project and how to craft a winning proposal or great cover letter to get a top agent and book editor to say yes.

Through extensive research and interviews with Chester Gould (the creator of ""Dick Tracy""), his assistants, Dick Locher (the current artist), Max Allan Collins (who scripted the stories for more than 15 years) and many others associated with the strip, Dick Tracy as a cultural icon emerges. The strips use of both innovative and established police methods and the true-to-life portrayals of Tracy's family and fellow cops are detailed.

"Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870-2005","Juris Dilevko, Candice F.C. Magowan",0786429259,9780786429257,2007,McFarland,259,0.0,0,"Beginning in the early 1980s, readers' advisory services were a widely discussed topic in North American public libraries. By 2005, almost every public library in the United States and Canada offered some form of readers' advisory service. The services offered have changed significantly, in ways perhaps disadvantageous to adult North American library patrons. This book provides a critical history of readers' advisory philosophy and offers a new perspective on the evolution of the service. The book analyzes the debate that shaped readers' advisory and discusses how the service has assumed its present form. The study follows readers' advisory through its three prominent stages of development, beginning with the period 1870 to 1916, when the service was still a subject of much crucial debate about its meaning and purpose. During the second phase (1917 to 1962), readers' advisory systematically committed itself to meaningful adult education through serious and purposeful reading. The book argues, however, that during the most recent phase of readers' advisory, from 1963 until the present, contemporary public libraries have turned their backs on the rich heritage of readers' advisory services by valorizing the reading of entertainment-oriented and commodified genre titles and bestsellers. Historical analysis, case studies and statistical charts augment the book's central argument.",['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Language Arts & Disciplines']",mystery_additional,I3OuBAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The diversity of this much-loved genre is breathtaking, and so much greater than many critics have suggested. To illustrate this, the leading expert on classic crime discusses one hundred books ranging from The Hound of the Baskervilles to Strangers on a Train which highlight the entertaining plots, the literary achievements, and the social significance of vintage crime fiction. This book serves as a companion to the acclaimed British Library Crime Classics series but it tells a very diverse story. It presents the development of crime fiction—from Sherlock Holmes to the end of the golden age—in an accessible, informative and engaging style. Readers who enjoy classic crime will make fascinating discoveries and learn about forgotten gems as well as bestselling authors. Even the most widely read connoisseurs will find books (and trivia) with which they are unfamiliar—as well as unexpected choices to debate. Classic crime is a richly varied and deeply pleasurable genre that is enjoying a world-wide renaissance as dozens of neglected novels and stories are resurrected for modern readers to enjoy.

Since the first Martin-Beck novel of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo appeared in 1965, the socially-critical crime novel has figured prominently in Scandinavian culture, and found hundreds of millions of readers outside Scandinavia. But is there truly a Scandinavian crime novel tradition? Scandinavian Crime Fiction identifies distinct features and changes in the Scandinavian crime tradition through analysis of some of its most well-known writers: Henning Mankell, Stieg Larsson, Anne Holt, Liza Marklund, Leena Lehtolainen, and Arnaldur Indrioason, among others. Focusing on Scandinavian crime fiction's snowballing prominence since the 1990s, articles zoom in on the transformation of the genre's social criticism, study the significance of cultural and geographical place in the tradition, and analyze the cultural politics of crime fiction, including struggles over gender equity, sexuality, ethnicity, history, and the fate of the welfare state.

When divers discover an antique car with a skeleton inside, the Beacon Group dispatches TK O’Connor to lead the investigation into the sixty-year-old cold case. It’s TK’s first chance at lead investigator, and the former Marine is determined not to let her team down. But almost as soon as she arrives in the downtrodden rustbelt Pennsylvania town, her challenges mount. First, there’s the issue of identifying the man inside the car.

A white police officer is on trial for shooting a black man and the verdict is due any minute. When a second killing occurs, TK suddenly finds herself at the center of a new investigation while the town literally explodes around her. As protesters storm the once peaceful town, it’s up to TK and her boss, Lucy Guardino, to untangle the truth, both past and present.

A tormented detective. One chance to save his best friend. Fresh off leave after a justified shooting, Edward Petrosky is battling his own brain as much as he is the world around him. His ex-wife has finally stopped calling, and he’s even pulled away from his neighbors. The chief of police might be the only person helping to keep Petrosky sober. When a woman is found dead near a local running trail, the city goes on high alert. Not only was the victim posed, but her body had been altered as if a crazy plastic surgeon had taken a scalpel to her. This killer is meticulous, careful—in Petrosky’s experience, the most dangerous kind of psycho. But then a second victim turns up, and she hasn’t been mutilated in quite the same way. Strange for a perfectionist suspect. Had the perp been interrupted, or is there a more sinister explanation? Perhaps they’re dealing with a copycat, or a pair of killers—the citizens of Ash Park might be in more peril than Petrosky had anticipated. But when the chief of police is abducted, the case shifts into unchartered territory. The killer they’re after doesn’t just want to play with his victims—he wants notoriety. And the only way he’ll get it is if Petrosky opens up about the case, a move that could put the chief’s life in more danger. And that’s a risk Petrosky cannot take. Petrosky’s only shot is to find their perp before the maniac slices into his boss—the only friend he hasn’t managed to push away. Can he catch the killer and muzzle his demons? Or will this case awaken the devil he’s been trying to silence? Composed is a dark, twisted thrill ride from bestselling author Meghan O’Flynn.

For fans of Rachel Abbott, Lucinda Berry, and Criminal Minds, this thriller will keep you guessing until the last page. Witness is the tenth novel in the Ash Park series, though all novels in the Ash Park world can be read as standalones. A missing victim. A deceitful family. And a detective too close to come out unscathed. Detective Edward Petrosky has seen his share of horrors—abused children, terrified assault victims, and of course, the vicious predators who don’t stop killing until someone like Petrosky puts them away. It’s no wonder he needs a little whiskey to take the edge off. So he’s relieved when he gets a call on a burglary—he’ll take stolen laptops over dead bodies any day. But he quickly learns this is no ordinary housebreak. There’s a considerable amount of blood at the scene, though the owner doesn’t appear injured. And Petrosky recognizes him as a man accused of sexual assault years prior; his psycho relatives are more cult than family. When the neighbors identify their burglary suspect, the case goes sideways—it’s not possible. How could a woman who burned to death along with her husband nearly a decade before, a relative of the homeowner, be the one fleeing the crime? If the witnesses are correct, and the woman faked her death…that means she murdered her own husband. What possible reason could she have to return? It doesn’t help that Shannon, Petrosky’s surrogate daughter and wife of his murdered partner, appears to be at the center of the conspiracy.

""A captivating thriller about the power of the things we wish we could forget."" ~Bestselling Author Mary Widdicks Where is the line between killer and hero? Things are finally looking up for Detective Petrosky. Sure, his daughter’s still dead, his granddaughter’s in another state, and they keep putting lemon in his freaking water, but he’s sober, his ex-wife no longer hates him—as much—and his new partner is as good at police work as she is at matching his snarky comebacks. But criminals don’t take a break; those bastards never sleep. When a councilman’s son is brutally murdered, the city explodes into controversy. Though the teen appears to have been ambushed in a random attack, there’s no forensic evidence at the scene, and the boy’s neck was snapped as quickly and efficiently as if it were a professional hit. Was the murder politically motivated? Or was the victim involved in something else—something bigger? Perhaps the slaying is linked to the old crime scene photos the victim had been collecting, some from cases Petrosky himself worked. And whoever murdered their victim killed at least two others. Ash Park may be dealing with a serial killer five years in the making. But the victims from these older cases are far from innocent—each appears to have been killed during an attempted rape. Is their suspect a cold-blooded murderer, or a hero vigilante? And what does any of it have to do with the councilman’s son? All Petrosky knows is that until now, their perp has been protecting the most vulnerable citizens of Ash Park from the very worst of humanity—from the criminals Petrosky himself has spent his entire career trying to put away. And Petrosky isn’t sure he wants him to stop. Riveting, and as dark as it is mysterious, Recall pushes the boundaries of right and wrong and turns the notion of justice on its head. Recall is the seventh book in the Ash Park series, though all novels in the Ash Park world can be read as standalones.

Try this intense thriller today! Perfect for fans of Gregg Olsen, Kendra Elliot, and Teresa Driscoll. “Wickedly entertaining . . . the perfect precursor to the Ash Park series, and every bit as shocking.” ~Bestselling Author Kristen Mae THE ASH PARK SERIES STARTS HERE… Edward Petrosky joined the Ash Park police force with two goals in mind: escape the military and silence the demons that followed him home from the war. And no one soothes those traumas better than his fiancé, Heather—he doesn't even mind that she has a checkered past of her own. But his dreams are obliterated when one night, on a routine call, Ed stumbles upon a scene as horrifying as any he’s seen in combat: Heather’s bloody body, half-buried in the snow. Though his superiors order him to stay away from the investigation, Ed can’t help but notice the inconsistencies in Heather’s case—her supposed cause of death doesn’t mesh with what she’s told him about her past. When another body turns up, Ed realizes that Heather’s murder wasn’t an isolated act of violence; this new victim was connected to the same shelter where Heather volunteered and attended the same church where a kindly priest seems to know more about the murders than he should. And the detectives working the case seem indifferent to these links despite being no closer to finding Heather’s killer. Now Ed must choose whether to play by the rules or sacrifice his career to seek justice for the woman he was supposed to spend his life with. One thing’s for certain: Ed can’t go down without a fight, because Ed isn’t the only one seeking vengeance. And in Ash Park, the innocents aren’t always who they appear to be.

In a genre long dominated by men, women are now taking their place-as authors and as characters-alongside hardboiled legends like Sam Spade and Mike Hammer. Hardboiled and High Heeled examines the meteoric rise of the female detective in contemporary film, television, and literature. Epitomized by such icons as Clarice Starling of Silence of the Lambs, Agent Scully of The X-Files, and Cagney and Lacey, and the heroines in best-selling novels by Sue Grafton and Patricia Cornwell, the woman detective has become a top-selling commodity with a hungry fan base. The number of female investigator novels has tripled every five years since 1985. Today, there are nearly 700 women writers of detective fiction, and more than 800 book series devoted to female detectives. In this book, Linda Mizejewski - author of Ziegfeld Girl - examines the far-reaching appeal of the woman detective. She argues that the female detective attracts a wide range of fans - straight and gay, male and female - by rebuking tradition and overturning gender stereotypes. Richly illustrated and written with a fan's love of the genre, Hardboiled and High Heeled is an essential introduction to women in detective fiction, from past to present, from pulp fiction to blockbuster films.",['Education'],"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Education']",mystery_additional,IqySAgAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Though Savage is the eleventh installment in the Ash Park series, all books in the Ash Park world can be read as standalones. Perfect for fans of Gregg Olsen, Kendra Elliot, and Teresa Driscoll. “Riveting, sharp, and mercilessly suspenseful, Savage is a masterfully constructed thriller from one of the best authors in the genre.” ~Bestselling Author Emerald O’Brien Petrosky’s back, and so is his most vicious rival: the man who killed his partner. Things are looking up for Detective Edward Petrosky. His grandkids are back in town, the girls next door are remarkably well-adjusted, and he’s solving homicides as quickly as ever. It doesn’t matter that he’s sneaking shots before morning briefings; whiskey or no, he’s still getting the job done. But his tenuous grasp on professionalism falters when he’s called to the scene of a kidnapping—the waitress from the diner he frequents has gone missing, the only server who knows he takes his coffee with a little liquor. And she’s due with her first baby any day. It isn’t long before they find her newborn child abandoned in a nearby cellar—does that mean the woman is already dead? And the infant isn’t even the most distressing piece of evidence. Petrosky cannot overlook the similarities to a past case he wishes he could forget, a brutal pattern of abductions that ended with a killer torturing young women to death in his basement. That same savage killed his partner, a man Petrosky had regarded as his son. But it’s not possible—years ago, Petrosky himself watched that maniac’s head explode in a shower of red mist. Could it be a copycat? The series of dead men found shrink-wrapped in their cars seems to suggest a serial killer patterned after the murder of his partner. But Petrosky can’t shake the feeling that there is more to the connection than they can see. Perhaps their current suspect knew the original killer—even psychos sometimes had accomplices. Or fall guys. When one of his neighbors is kidnapped, a girl he sees as family, Petrosky’s suspicions are confirmed. Clues left at the scene lead them to the weapon used to slit his partner’s throat, one piece of the puzzle they’d never been able to locate. This isn’t just evidence. It’s a warning. It may be impossible, but it’s true: the man who killed his partner has returned, and he’s taking the people Petrosky loves one by one. Will Petrosky be able to locate a killer more cunning than any he’s ever encountered? Or will his fragile grasp on sanity finally snap? If you liked Sharp Objects or The Wire, you’ll love Savage.

""Savagery, style, sophistication, sleuthing and sex,"" said Ellery Queen. Often a desperate blond, a jealous husband, and, of course, a tough-but-tender P.I. the likes of Sam Spade or Philop Marlowe. Perhaps Raymond Chandler summed it up best in his description of Dashiell Hammett's style: ""Hammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it....He put these people down on paper as they were, and he made them talk and think in the language they customarily used for these purposes."" Hard-Boiled: An Anthology of American Crime Stories is the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind, with over half of the stories never published before in book form. Included are thirty-six sublimely suspenseful stories that chronicle the evolutiuon of this quintessentially American art form, from its earliest beginnings during the Golden Age of the legendary pulp magazine Black Mask in the 1920s, to the arrival of the tough digest Manhunt in the 1950s, and finally leading up to present-day hard-boiled stories by such writers as James Ellroy. Here are eight decades worth of the best writing about betrayal, murder, and mayhem: from Hammett's 1925 tour de force ""The Scorched Face,"" in which the disappearance of two sisters leads Hammett's never-named detective, the Continental Op, straight into a web of sexual blackmail amidst the West Coast elite, to Ed Gorman's 1992 ""The Long Silence After,"" a gripping and powerful rendezvous involving a middle class insurance executive, a Chicago streetwalker, and a loaded .38. Other delectable contributions include ""Brush Fire"" by James M. Cain, author of The Postman Always Rings Twice, Raymond Chandler's ""I'll Be Waiting,"" where, for once, the femme fatale is not blond but a redhead, a Ross Macdonald mystery starring Macdonald's most famous creation, the cryptic Lew Archer, and ""The Screen Test of Mike Hammer"" by the one and only Micky Spillane. The hard-boiled cult has more in common with the legendary lawmen of the Wild West than with the gentleman and lady sleuths of traditional drawing room mysteries, and this direct line of descent is on brilliant display in two of the most subtle and tautly written stories in the collection, Elmore Leonard's ""3:10 to Yuma"" and John D. MacDonald's ""Nor Iron Bars."" Other contributors include Evan Hunter (better known as Ed McBain), Jim Thompson, Helen Nielsen, Margaret Maron, Andrew Vachss, Faye Kellerman, and Lawrence Block.

In 1976, critic Paul Nelson spent several weeks interviewing legendary detective writer Ross Macdonald, who elevated the form to a new literary level. “We talked about everything imaginable,” Nelson wrote―including Macdonald’s often meager beginnings; his dual citizenship; writers, painters, music, and movies he admired; The Great Gatsby, his favorite book; how he used symbolism to change detective writing; and more. This book, published in a handsome, oversized format, collects these unpublished interviews and is a visual history of Macdonald’s professional career. It is illustrated with rare and select items from one of the world’s largest private archives of Macdonald ephemera; reproduces, in full color, the covers of the various editions of Macdonald’s more than two dozen books; collects facsimile reproductions of select pages from his manuscripts, as well as magazine spreads; and presents rare photos, many never before seen.",['Biography & Autobiography'],"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Biography & Autobiography']",mystery_additional,OPHPCgAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Author in Chief,Craig Fehrman,1476786593,9781476786599,2020,Simon and Schuster,448,0.0,0,"“One of the best books on the American presidency to appear in recent years” (The Wall Street Journal) and based on a decade of research and reporting—a delightful new window into the public and private lives America’s presidents as authors. Most Americans are familiar with Abraham Lincoln’s famous words in the Gettysburg Address and the Eman­cipation Proclamation. Yet few can name the work that helped him win the presidency: his published collection of speeches entitled Political Debates between Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln labored in secret to get his book ready for the 1860 election, tracking down newspaper transcripts, editing them carefully for fairness, and hunting for a printer who would meet his specifications. Political Debates sold fifty thousand copies—the rough equivalent of half a million books in today’s market—and it reveals something about Lincoln’s presidential ambitions. But it also reveals something about his heart and mind. When voters asked about his beliefs, Lincoln liked to point them to his book. In Craig Fehrman’s “original, illuminating, and entertaining” (Jon Meacham) work of history, the story of America’s presidents and their books opens a rich new window into presidential biography. From volumes lost to history—Calvin Coolidge’s Autobiography, which was one of the most widely discussed titles of 1929—to ones we know and love—Barack Obama’s Dreams from My Father, which was very nearly never published—Fehrman unearths countless insights about the presidents through their literary works. Presidential books have made an enormous impact on American history, catapulting their authors to the national stage and even turning key elections. Beginning with Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia, the first presidential book to influence a campaign, and John Adams’s Autobiography, the first score-settling presiden­tial memoir, Author in Chief draws on newly uncovered information—including never-before-published letters from Andrew Jackson, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan—to cast fresh light on the private drives and self-doubts that fueled our nation’s leaders. We see Teddy Roosevelt as a vulnerable first-time author, struggling to write the book that would become a classic of American history. We see Reagan painstakingly revising Where’s the Rest of Me?, and Donald Trump negotiating the deal for The Art of the Deal, the volume that made him synonymous with business savvy. Alongside each of these authors, we also glimpse the everyday Americans who read them. “If you’re a history buff, a presidential trivia aficionado, or just a lover of American literary history, this book will transfix you, inform you, and surprise you” (The Seattle Review of Books).",['Political Science'],"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Political Science']",mystery_additional,mrqeDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Kat Harper's first day at her new job doesn't go as planned when a runaway cat leads her to a dead body outside of her office building. Things only get worse when Sadie Cramer's death is deemed a homicide, and Kat has to wonder what she's gotten herself into by accepting this position. Much to Kat's—and her police detective boyfriend's—dismay, she soon encounters plenty of people with motive for murder. From an employee fired right before the Thanksgiving holiday, to a grown son ruthlessly cut out of an inheritance, it seems the late career counselor angered several people shortly before her passing. And now it's up to the office building's newly hired amateur sleuth to figure out exactly who is guilty . . . preferably without turning into a victim herself.

Book Wars,John B. Thompson,1509546790,9781509546794,2021,John Wiley & Sons,357,0.0,0,"This book tells the story of the turbulent decades when the book publishing industry collided with the great technological revolution of our time. From the surge of ebooks to the self-publishing explosion and the growing popularity of audiobooks, Book Wars provides a comprehensive and fine-grained account of technological disruption in one of our most important and successful creative industries. Like other sectors, publishing has been thrown into disarray by the digital revolution. The foundation on which this industry had been based for 500 years – the packaging and sale of words and images in the form of printed books – was called into question by a technological revolution that enabled symbolic content to be stored, manipulated and transmitted quickly and cheaply. Publishers and retailers found themselves facing a proliferation of new players who were offering new products and services and challenging some of their most deeply held principles and beliefs. The old industry was suddenly thrust into the limelight as bitter conflicts erupted between publishers and new entrants, including powerful new tech giants who saw the world in very different ways. The book wars had begun. While ebooks were at the heart of many of these conflicts, Thompson argues that the most fundamental consequences lie elsewhere. The print-on-paper book has proven to be a remarkably resilient cultural form, but the digital revolution has transformed the industry in other ways, spawning new players which now wield unprecedented power and giving rise to an array of new publishing forms. Most important of all, it has transformed the broader information and communication environment, creating new challenges and new opportunities for publishers as they seek to redefine their role in the digital age. This unrivalled account of the book publishing industry as it faces its greatest challenge since Gutenberg will be essential reading for anyone interested in books and their future.",['Social Science'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Social Science']",scifi,GbAhEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Soundtracked Books from the Acoustic Era to the Digital Age,Justin St. Clair,1000591646,9781000591644,2022,Routledge,135,0.0,0,"Offering both a short history and a theoretical framework, this book is the first extended study of the soundtracked book as a media form. A soundtracked book is a print or digital publication for which a recorded, musical complement has been produced. Early examples were primarily developed for the children's market, but by the middle of the twentieth century, ethnographers had begun producing book-and-record combinations that used print to contextualize musical artifacts. The last half-century has witnessed the rapid expansion of the adult market, including soundtracked novels from celebrated writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Kathy Acker, and Mark Z. Danielewski. While often dismissed as gimmicks, this volume argues that soundtracked books represent an interesting case study in media consumption. Unlike synchronous multimedia forms, the vast majority of soundtracked books require that audience activity be split between reading and listening, thus defining the user experience and often shaping the content of singing books as well. Mapping the form's material evolution, this book charts a previously unconsidered pathway through more than a century of recording formats and packaging strategies, emphasizing the synergies and symbioses that characterize the marriage of sound and print. As such, it will be of value to scholars and postgraduate students working in media studies, literary studies, and sound studies.",['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Language Arts & Disciplines']",scifi,Zx1tEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

During this period factors such as the expansion of government, the growth of higher education, the climate of the Cold War, globalization, and the development of multimedia and digital technologies influenced the patterns of consolidation and diversification established earlier. The thirty-three contributors to the volume explore the evolution of the publishing industry and the business of bookselling. The histories of government publishing, law and policy, the periodical press, literary criticism, and reading--in settings such as schools, libraries, book clubs, self-help programs, and collectors' societies--receive imaginative scrutiny as well. The Enduring Book demonstrates that the corporate consolidations of the last half-century have left space for the independent publisher, that multiplicity continues to define American print culture, and that even in the digital age, the book endures.

Women can’t lie or fall in love. Fathers feed their children ghost preserves. Souls chase one another through animal incarnations. Yet these stories are grounded deeply in our reality. Out of these stories’ weirdness emerges the cruelty of border enforcement, the horror of legislation restricting reproductive freedom, the frightening pace of AI.

In addition to a literary form, it also encompasses film, TV, comics, toys and our beloved toy astronauts, or other figures such as aliens, monsters and other playable genres. The term science fiction was coined by publisher Hugo Gernsbach around the first decades of the last century to refer to the predominantly 'space' adventures covered in his magazines. Space invaded radio, cinema, TV, and consequently for a long time toy figurines were predominantly space-related, later evolving into other themes. This lavishly illustrated book covers both the history of literary science fiction, following in the footsteps of contemporary official criticism, and toy figurines inspired by science fiction. You will also find several other themes, such as the link between science fiction figures and cinema, radio, TV, comics, and more. Luigi Toiati offers to both guide the reader on an often-nostalgic walk through science fiction in all its various forms, and to describe the figurines and brands associated with it.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Literary Criticism']",scifi,Aq3YEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The Novelist in the Novel,Elizabeth King,1000965481,9781000965483,2023,Taylor & Francis,241,0.0,0,"Why do writers so often write about writers? This book offers the first comprehensive account of the phenomenon of the fictional novelist as a character in literature, arguing that our notions of literary genius – and what it means to be an author – are implicitly shaped by and explicitly challenged in novels about novelists, a genre that has been critically underexamined. Employing both close and distant reading techniques to analyse a large corpus of author-stories, The Novelist in the Novel explores the forms and functions of author-stories and the characters within them, offering a new theory that frames these works as textual sites at which questions of literary value and the cultural conceptions around authorship are constantly being negotiated and revised in a form of covert criticism aimed directly at readers. While nineteenth-century novels about novelists reveal a pervasive frustration with the market – a starving artist vs. commercial sell-out dichotomy – modernist examples of the genre focus on the development of the individual author-as-artist, entirely aloof from the marketplace and from the literary sphere at large. Yet, each of these dynamics is gendered, with women denigrated to commercial producers and men elevated to artists, and while the canon has largely supported the male view of authorship, a closer look at the work of women writers from this period reveals concerted attempts to counteract it. ""Silly Lady Novelists"" are pitted against serious male modernists in a battle to define what it means to be a literary genius.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Literary Criticism']",scifi,jAvXEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Once every cycle, the great galactic civilizations gather for the Metagalactic Grand Prix—part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part continuation of the wars of the past. Species far and wide compete in feats of song, dance and/or whatever facsimile of these can be performed by various creatures who may or may not possess, in the traditional sense, feet, mouths, larynxes, or faces. And if a new species should wish to be counted among the high and the mighty, if a new planet has produced some savage group of animals, machines, or algae that claim to be, against all odds, sentient? Well, then they will have to compete. And if they fail? Sudden extermination for their entire species. This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick, and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny—they must sing. Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes have been chosen to represent their planet on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of Earth lies in their ability to rock.",['Fiction'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Fiction']",scifi,1ZqxDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The death toll has climbed ever higher, year after year, with no end in sight. But the members of the Five Hundred, the social elite of the Republic’s Heart Worlds, don’t care. Rear Admiral Terrence Murphy is a Heart Worlder. His family is part of the Five Hundred. His wife is the daughter of one of the Five Hundred’s wealthiest, most powerful industrialists. His sons and his daughter can easily avoid military service, and political power is his for the taking. There is no end to how high he can rise in the Republic’s power structure. All he has to do is successfully complete a risk-free military “governorship” in the backwater Fringe System of New Dublin without rocking the boat. But the people sending him to New Dublin have miscalculated, because Terrence Murphy is a man who believes in honor. Who believes in duty—in common decency and responsibility. Who believes there are dark and dangerous secrets behind the façade of what “everyone knows.” Terrence Murphy intends to meet those responsibilities, to unearth those secrets, and he doesn’t much care what the Five Hundred want. He intends to put a stop to the killing. Terrence Murphy is coming for whoever has orchestrated fifty-six years of bloodshed and slaughter, and Hell itself is coming with him.

That Book Is Dangerous!,Adam Szetela,0262049856,9780262049856,2025,MIT Press,283,0.0,0,"An alarming exposé of the new challenges to literary freedom in the age of social media—when anyone with an identity and an internet connection can be a censor. In That Book Is Dangerous!, Adam Szetela investigates how well-intentioned and often successful efforts to diversify American literature have also produced serious problems for literary freedom. Although progressives are correct to be focused on right-wing attempts at legislative censorship, Szetela argues for attention to the ways that left-wing censorship controls speech within the publishing industry itself. The author draws on interviews with presidents and vice presidents at the Big Five publishers, literary agents at the most prestigious agencies, award-winning authors, editors, marketers, sensitivity readers, and other industry professionals to examine the new publishing landscape. What he finds is unsettling: mandatory sensitivity reads; morality clauses in author contracts; even censorship of “dangerous” books in the name of antiracism, feminism, and other forms of social justice. These changes to acquisition practices, editing policies, and other aspects of literary culture are a direct outgrowth of the culture of public outcries on X, Goodreads, Change.org, and other online platforms, where users accuse authors—justifiably or not—of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other transgressions. But rather than genuinely address the economic inequities of literary production, this current moral crusade over literature serves only to entrench the status quo. “While the right is remaking the world in its image,” he writes, “the left is standing in a circular firing squad.” Compellingly argued and incisively written, the book is a much-needed wake-up call for anyone who cares about reading, writing, and the publication of books—as well as the generations of young readers we are raising.",['Social Science'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Social Science']",scifi,8bgwEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Once out of school, most of us read for pleasure. Yet there is another equally important, though often overlooked, reason that we read: to learn how to live. Though books have always been understood as life-teachers, the exact way in which they instruct, cajole, and convince remains a subject of some mystery. Drawing on sources as diverse as Dr. Seuss and Simone Weil, P. G. Wodehouse and Isaiah Berlin, Pulitzer Prize–winning critic Michael Dirda shows how the wit, wisdom, and enchantment of the written word can inform and enrich nearly every aspect of life, from education and work to love and death. Organized by significant life events and abounding with quotations from great writers and thinkers, Book by Book showcases Dirda's considerable knowledge, which he wears lightly. Favoring showing rather than telling, Dirda draws the reader deeper into the classics, as well as lesser-known works of literature, history, and philosophy, always with an eye to what is relevant to how we might better understand our lives.

For almost a hundred years, Hadrian Marlowe has served the Empire in its war against the Cielcin, a vicious alien race bent on humanity’s destruction. Rumors of a new king amongst the Cielcin have reached the Imperial throne. This one is not like the others. It does not raid borderworld territories, preferring precise, strategic attacks on the humans’ Empire. To make matters worse, a cult of personality has formed around Hadrian, spurred on by legends of his having defied death itself. Men call him Halfmortal. Hadrian’s rise to prominence proves dangerous to himself and his team, as pressures within the Imperial government distrust or resent his new influence. Caught in the middle, Hadrian must contend with enemies before him—and behind. And above it all, there is the mystery of the Quiet. Hadrian did defy death. He did return.

Comics and Stuff,Henry Jenkins,1479831255,9781479831258,2020,NYU Press,442,0.0,0,"Considers how comics display our everyday stuff—junk drawers, bookshelves, attics—as a way into understanding how we represent ourselves now For most of their history, comics were widely understood as disposable—you read them and discarded them, and the pulp paper they were printed on decomposed over time. Today, comic books have been rebranded as graphic novels—clothbound high-gloss volumes that can be purchased in bookstores, checked out of libraries, and displayed proudly on bookshelves. They are reviewed by serious critics and studied in university classrooms. A medium once considered trash has been transformed into a respectable, if not elite, genre. While the American comics of the past were about hyperbolic battles between good and evil, most of today’s graphic novels focus on everyday personal experiences. Contemporary culture is awash with stuff. They give vivid expression to a culture preoccupied with the processes of circulation and appraisal, accumulation and possession. By design, comics encourage the reader to scan the landscape, to pay attention to the physical objects that fill our lives and constitute our familiar surroundings. Because comics take place in a completely fabricated world, everything is there intentionally. Comics are stuff; comics tell stories about stuff; and they display stuff. When we use the phrase “and stuff” in everyday speech, we often mean something vague, something like “etcetera.” In this book, stuff refers not only to physical objects, but also to the emotions, sentimental attachments, and nostalgic longings that we express—or hold at bay—through our relationships with stuff. In Comics and Stuff, his first solo authored book in over a decade, pioneering media scholar Henry Jenkins moves through anthropology, material culture, literary criticism, and art history to resituate comics in the cultural landscape. Through over one hundred full-color illustrations, using close readings of contemporary graphic novels, Jenkins explores how comics depict stuff and exposes the central role that stuff plays in how we curate our identities, sustain memory, and make meaning. Comics and Stuff presents an innovative new way of thinking about comics and graphic novels that will change how we think about our stuff and ourselves.",['Social Science'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Social Science']",scifi,ufLRDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

In this first book-length study of the novel, which includes an extended interview with Noon, Wenaus considers how Vurt complicates the process of literary canonization, its constructivist relationship to genre, its violent and oneiric setting of Manchester, its use of the Orphic myth as an archetype for the practice of literary collage and musical remix, and how the structural paradoxes of chaos and fractal geometry inform the novel’s content, form, and theme. Finally, Wenaus makes the case for Vurt’s ongoing relevance in the 21st century, an era increasingly characterized by neuro-totalitarianism, psychopolitics, and digital surveillance. With Vurt, Noon begins his project of rupturing feedback loops of control by breaking narrative habits and embracing the contingent and unpredictable.

Fear the Future,Matthew Benjamin Cole,0472905333,9780472905331,2025,University of Michigan Press,305,0.0,0,"After centuries of contemplating utopias, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century writers began to warn of dystopian futures. Yet these fears extended beyond the canonical texts of dystopian fiction into postwar discourses on totalitarianism, mass society, and technology, as well as subsequent political theories of freedom and domination. Fear the Future demonstrates the centrality of dystopian thinking to twentieth century political thought, showing the pervasiveness of dystopian images, themes, and anxieties. Offering a novel reading of major themes and thinkers, Fear the Future explores visions of the future from literary figures such as Yevgeny Zamyatin, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell; political theorists such as Max Weber, Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault; and mid-century social scientists such as Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, David Reisman, C. Wright Mills, and Jacques Ellul. It offers a comparative analysis of distinct intellectual and literary traditions, including modern utopianism and anti-utopianism, midcentury social science, Frankfurt School critical theory, and continental political philosophy. With detailed case studies of key thinkers from the Enlightenment to the late twentieth century, the book synthesizes secondary literature and research from a range of disciplinary areas, including in political theory, intellectual history, literary studies, and utopian studies. This wide-ranging reconstruction shows that while dystopian thinking has illustrated the dangers of domination and dehumanization, it has also illuminated new possibilities for freedom.",['Political Science'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Political Science']",scifi,ig5lEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The Politics of Panem,Sean P. Connors,9462098069,9789462098060,2014,Springer,227,0.0,0,"The Hunger Games trilogy is a popular culture success. Embraced by adults as well as adolescents, Suzanne Collins’s bestselling books have inspired an equally popular film franchise. But what, if anything, can reading the Hunger Games tell us about what it means to be human in the world today? What complex social and political issues does the trilogy invite readers to explore? Does it merely entertain, or does it also instruct? Bringing together scholars in literacy education and the humanities, The Politics of Panem: Challenging Genres examines how the Hunger Games books and films, when approached from the standpoint of theory, can challenge readers and viewers intellectually. At the same time, by subjecting Collins’s trilogy to literary criticism, this collection of essays challenges its complexity as an example of dystopian literature for adolescents. How can applying philosophic frameworks such as those attributable to Socrates and Foucault to the Hunger Games trilogy deepen our appreciation for the issues it raises? What, if anything, can we learn from considering fan responses to the Hunger Games? How might adapting the trilogy for film complicate its ability to engage in sharp-edged social criticism? By exploring these and other questions, The Politics of Panem: Challenging Genres invites teachers, students, and fans of the Hunger Games to consider how Collins’s trilogy, as a representative of young adult dystopian fiction, functions as a complex narrative. In doing so, it highlights questions and issues that lend themselves to critical exploration in secondary and college classrooms.",['Education'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Education']",scifi,QuuZBAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Neoliberalism and Young Adult Fiction,"Sean P. Connors, Roberta Seelinger Trites",1496855817,9781496855817,2025,Univ. Press of Mississippi,173,0.0,0,"In the twenty-first century, the influence of neoliberalism, the belief that society benefits when both individuals and corporations are free to maximize their talents in the service of responding to social needs and problems, resonates through all domains of human life. And yet, little critical study has been given to the reproduction of a neoliberal social order in YA literature. Neoliberalism and Young Adult Fiction: Exceptionalism, Exploitation, and Erasure examines how some YA literature naturalizes neoliberalism in positioning teenagers as self-enclosed, competitive individuals. At the same time, however, the authors also examine other YA novels as potential sites of resistance that acknowledge teenagers’ agency to reject neoliberalism’s destructive impulses and to work for social justice and equality through collective action. With that in mind, the authors of Neoliberalism and Young Adult Fiction analyze such concepts as how the exceptionality of specific characters who embody neoliberal ideals leads to self-enclosed individualism and how environmental exploitation and consumerism lead to destructive effects. The book progresses to an in-depth examination of how racism undergirds US neoliberalism and environmental exploitation. From scrutinizing racism—and the rejection of neoliberalism inherent in the antiracism movement—the study turns to an examination of gender, specifically focusing on the relationship between sexism, exploitation, and embodied rejections of patriarchal thinking. Indeed, erasure is implicated in racism, sexism, and all forms of discrimination that are borne of exploitation. Finally, youth activism—with its rejection of neoliberal ideologies—leads to a culminating chapter about how global youth link YA literature to their protest movements.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Literary Criticism']",scifi,mcJGEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

From Henry James’s dreamlike utopia of “The Great Good Place” to the psychotic world of Brett Easton Ellis’s American Psycho, from science fiction and recent horror films, television adaptations of books such as Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, and new series such as Black Mirror to the repressive Hitlerian dystopia of Katherine Burdekin’s Swastika Night, the contributors examine the development of scenarios that either prefigure the rise of individuals such as Donald J.

Bad Old Days,Alan J. Levine,141281197X,9781412811972,2011,Transaction Publishers,187,0.0,0,"For many, especially those on the political left, the 1950s are the ""bad old days."" The widely accepted list of what was allegedly wrong with that decade includes the Cold War, McCarthyism, racial segregation, self-satisfied prosperity, and empty materialism. The failings are coupled with ignoring poverty and other social problems, complacency, conformity, the suppression of women, and puritanical attitudes toward sex. In all, the conventional wisdom sees the decade as bland and boring, with commonly accepted people paralyzed with fear of war, Communism, or McCarthyism, or all three. Alan J. Levine, shows that the commonly accepted picture of the 1950s is flawed. It distorts a critical period of American history. That distortion seems to be dictated by an ideological agenda, including an emotional obsession with a sentimentalized version of the 1960s that in turn requires maintaining a particular, misleading view of the post-World War II era that preceded it. Levine argues that a critical view of the 1950s is embedded in an unwillingness to realistically evaluate the evolution of American society since the 1960s. Many--and not only liberals and those further to the left--desperately desire to avoid seeing, or admitting, just how badly many things have gone in the United States since the 1960s. Bad Old Days shows that the conventional view of the 1950s stands in opposition to the reality of the decade. Far from being the dismal prelude to a glorious period of progress, the postwar period of the late 1940s and 1950s was an era of unprecedented progress and prosperity. This era was then derailed by catastrophic political and economic misjudgments and a drastic shift in the national ethos that contributed nothing, or less than nothing, to a better world.",['Social Science'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Social Science']",scifi,IzCg3w2eP2UC,,0,,[],0.0

Posthumanist critical concerns try to dismantle anthropocentric notions of the human and defend the need for a closer relationship between humanity and the environment. Supported by the exemplification of the generic characteristics of the cli-fi genre, this book discusses the effects of climate change, at the individual level, and as a collective threat that can lead to a ""world without us.""

Toliver, Jason Vanfosson, Sarah E. Whitney, and Casey Alane Wilson While critical and popular attention afforded to twenty-first-century young adult literature has exponentially increased in recent years, classroom materials and scholarship have remained static in focus and slight in scope. Twilight, The Hunger Games, The Fault in Our Stars, and The Hate U Give overwhelm conversations among scholars and critics—but these are far from the only texts in need of analysis. Beyond the Blockbusters: Themes and Trends in Contemporary Young Adult Fiction offers a necessary remedy to this limiting perspective, bringing together essays about the many subgenres, themes, and character types that have until now been overlooked. The collection tackles a diverse range of topics—modern updates to the marriage plot; fairy tale retellings in dystopian settings; stories of extrajudicial police killings and racial justice. The approaches are united, though, by a commitment to exploring the large-scale generic and theoretical structures at work in each set of texts. As a collection, Beyond the Blockbusters is an exciting entryway into a field that continues to grow and change even as its works captivate massive audiences. It will prove a crucial addition to the library of any scholar or instructor of young adult literature.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Literary Criticism']",scifi,NmbTDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
The Plantation Series Box Set I: Books 1-3,Stella Fitzsimons,,,2014,Butterfly Electric Press,369,0.0,0,"When the light of the human species vanished, there was a girl... and a spark. In a world come to an end, one girl and one ragtag group of teen slaves find each other in the dark woods. They plan to make a stand. This collection includes the first three novels in the bestselling dystopian series THE PLANTATION. (BOOKS: The Plantation, The Dark Legion, The Shadow Empire.) THE PLANTATION (Book 1) A century has passed since they arrived. Human history has been erased. Children are enslaved on Alien plantations. Some have heard whispers of the existence of a rebel band of humans who roam free in the forests. Most slaves dare not speak of the rebels for fear the mutant guards will grab and make an example of them. Seventeen-year-old Freya is pulled away in the night not by the mutants, but by her old friend Finn, to join the Saviors, the mythic band of rebel teens. Her bliss fades when she discovers she is the only Savior without a special ability. She is the odd one out, slowly pushing Finn away, defying Damian, the leader of the Saviors, and antagonizing the fierce and beautiful Daphne. In her despair Freya reaches deep within to discover a dark destiny, a truth so heavy it threatens to destroy her. THE DARK LEGION (Book 2) They have waited for her all these years, even before she was born. She lives hidden from their vulture-like drones, hidden in the dark, cavernous lair of her enemies. The unseen ones will come for her. They must come for her. Their very existence depends on finding her, the girl with the gift of light, of power, of life. Haunted by a past she does not understand, by a destiny they plan for her, Freya must leave the Saviors behind, leave Damian and Finn, leave even little Pip and embark on a perilous journey with a beastly warrior. She will venture out beyond the ends of the charted lands, risking all she holds dear to cross the dead zone to where the Dark Legion awaits. THE SHADOW EMPIRE (Book 3) They come from a noble legacy of wonder and discovery. They cut through wormholes, portals and anomalies like shadows skipping across a celestial sea. The hooded ones appear in an instant and disappear in a fraction. Every sleeping child fears a glimpse of their ghastly faces in their darkest dreams. The Shadow Empire is dying. Their struggle for survival has reached a final battlefield in the forests of a primitive planet called Earth. Freya, the hunted one, the most wanted fugitive in the history of the empire, wants to make everything right in her own dying world. She feels rage flowing through her fingertips. She feels her broken heart hungering savage ways. She must become like nothing the world has ever known to save Damian, to save the floating city, to save Finn and Pip and little Tobi, too, but with war looming, will she be able to save her own soul?

Helping Students Become Climate Stewards,Xochitl Bentley,1040431771,9781040431771,2025,Taylor & Francis,140,0.0,0,"This resource examines the way storytelling can play a role in environmental problem-solving and climate stewardship. Narrative not only builds literacy but also fosters students’ critical thinking around the ways they inhabit their world. The author examines habits, myths, and mindsets that threaten our planet's ecosystems, and presents ""counter-stories"" you can use to build your middle and secondary students’ capacity for environmental advocacy. Chapters are organized around a framework for developing environmental literacy, each focusing on how storytelling can build the capacity for various roles within the realm of climate stewardship. Via practical entry points and pathways for lesson and unit design, educators can use narrative to help students envision themselves as systems thinkers, communicators, activists, problem solvers, and more. Each chapter uses different kinds of narratives, from fictional parables to comic storyboards, to present practices students can understand and try out. They also include case studies, writing exercises, lesson suggestions, planning tool organizers, and rubrics applicable throughout different curriculum areas.

Post-Apocalyptic Cultures,"Julia Urabayen, Jorge León Casero",3031505107,9783031505102,2024,Springer Nature,297,0.0,0,"This book advocates for the necessity of recovering the value of utopias as political projects that open new channels of action. The criticism of modern political utopias is based on the supposed impossibility of creating for the future because there is no longer a future (apocalyptic ideology). However, this edited collection seeks to show that the post-apocalyptic world in which we live entails a renewed freedom of design for the radical reorganization of institutions. Post-apocalyptic cultures are not obligated to follow the capitalist, anthropocentric, correlationist and sovereign modes of the old political project of emancipation—the Western enlightenment—that has started to collapse. With this in mind, this book is divided into four sections dedicated to the main themes from which to rethink the projects of political emancipation that are possible nowadays: technopolitics; posthumanist biopolitics; non-western politicsl and the crossover between arts and politics.",['History'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'History']",scifi,jF78EAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
The New Heroines,Katheryn Wright,,9798216122722,2016,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,197,0.0,0,"This book explores how the next generation of teen and young adult heroines in popular culture are creating a new feminist ideal for the 21st century. Representations of a teenage girl who is unique or special occur again and again in coming-of-age stories. It's an irresistible concept: the heroine who seems just like every other, but under the surface, she has the potential to change the world. This book examines the cultural significance of teen and young adult female characters—the New Heroines—in popular culture. The book addresses a wide range of examples primarily from the past two decades, with several chapters focusing on a specific heroic figure in popular culture. In addition, the author offers a comparative analysis between the ""New Woman"" figure from the late 19th and early 20th century and the New Heroine in the 21st century. Readers will understand how representations of teenage girls in fiction and nonfiction are positioned as heroic because of their ability to find out about themselves by connecting with other people, their environment, and technology.",['Social Science'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Social Science']",scifi,nY7CEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
The Sun Also Rises,Ernest Hemingway,6257287782,9786257287784,2023,E-Kitap Projesi & Cheapest Books,287,0.0,0,"The illustrated edition of Ernest Hemingway's first novel. The Sun Also Rises is a 1926 novel by American writer Ernest Hemingway, his first, that portrays American and British expatriates who travel from Paris to the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights. An early and enduring modernist novel, it received mixed reviews upon publication. However, Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes that it is now ""recognized as Hemingway's greatest work"", and Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin calls it his most important novel. The novel was published in the United States in October 1926 by Scribner's. A year later, Jonathan Cape published the novel in London under the title Fiesta. It remains in print. The novel is a roman à clef: the characters are based on real people in Hemingway's circle, and the action is based on real events, particularly Hemingway's life in Paris in the 1920s and a trip to Spain in 1925 for the Pamplona festival and fishing in the Pyrenees. Hemingway presents his notion that the ""Lost Generation""-considered to have been decadent, dissolute, and irretrievably damaged by World War I-was in fact resilient and strong. Hemingway investigates the themes of love and death, the revivifying power of nature, and the concept of masculinity. His spare writing style, combined with his restrained use of description to convey characterizations and action, demonstrates his ""Iceberg Theory"" of writing. Plot summary On the surface, the novel is a love story between the protagonist Jake Barnes-a man whose war wound has made him unable to have sex-and the promiscuous divorcée Lady Brett Ashley. Jake is an expatriate American journalist living in Paris, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman with bobbed hair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett's affair with Jake's college friend Robert Cohn causes Jake to be upset and break off his friendship with Robert; her seduction of the 19-year-old matador Romero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards in Pamplona. Book One is set in the café society of young American expatriates in Paris. In the opening scenes, Jake plays tennis with Robert, picks up a prostitute (Georgette), and runs into Brett and Count Mippipopolous in a nightclub. Later, Brett tells Jake she loves him, but they both know that they have no chance at a stable relationship. In Book Two, Jake is joined by Bill Gorton, recently arrived from New York, and Brett's fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives from Scotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Robert at Bayonne for a fishing trip in the hills northeast of Pamplona. Instead of fishing, Robert stays in Pamplona to wait for the overdue Brett and Mike. Robert had an affair with Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams near Burguete, they rejoin the group in Pamplona. All begin to drink heavily. Robert is resented by the others, who taunt him with antisemitic remarks. During the fiesta the characters drink, eat, watch the running of the bulls, attend bullfights, and bicker with each other. Jake introduces Brett to the 19-year-old matador Romero at the Hotel Montoya; she is smitten with him and seduces him.",['Fiction'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Fiction']",scifi,uXnlEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Much Ado About Nothing,William Shakespeare,6057566440,9786057566447,2024,E-Kitap Projesi & Cheapest Books,182,0.0,0,"Much Ado About Nothing, comedy in five acts by William Shakespeare, written probably in 1598–99 and printed in a quarto edition from the author's own manuscript in 1600. The play takes an ancient theme—that of a woman falsely accused of unfaithfulness—to brilliant comedic heights. Shakespeare used as his main source for the Claudio-Hero plot a story from Matteo Bandello's Novelle (1554–73); he also may have consulted Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando furioso and Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene. The Beatrice-Benedick plot is essentially Shakespeare's own, though he must have had in mind his own story of wife taming in The Taming of the Shrew. Leonato, a kindly, respectable nobleman, lives in the idyllic Italian town of Messina. Leonato shares his house with his lovely young daughter, Hero, his playful, clever niece, Beatrice, and his elderly brother, Antonio (who is Beatrice's father). As the play begins, Leonato prepares to welcome some friends home from a war. The friends include Don Pedro, a prince who is a close friend of Leonato, and two fellow soldiers: Claudio, a well-respected young nobleman, and Benedick, a clever man who constantly makes witty jokes, often at the expense of his friends. Don John, Don Pedro's illegitimate brother, is part of the crowd as well. Don John is sullen and bitter, and makes trouble for the others. When the soldiers arrive at Leonato's home, Claudio quickly falls in love with Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick and Beatrice resume the war of witty insults that they have carried on with each other in the past. Claudio and Hero pledge their love to one another and decide to be married. To pass the time in the week before the wedding, the lovers and their friends decide to play a game. They want to get Beatrice and Benedick, who are clearly meant for each other, to stop arguing and fall in love. Their tricks prove successful, and Beatrice and Benedick soon fall secretly in love with each other.",['Drama'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama']",scifi,7GYsEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Chrononaut Franc Lu has come a long, long way—from the twenty-fourth century, in fact—to be in New Jersey on the evening of May 6, 1937. Traveling four hundred years into the past, he and his partner have been sent by the Chronospace Research Centre to observe the infamous explosion of the zeppelin Hindenburg. But when the German airship touches down safely on the airfield in Lakehurst, Lu realizes that something has gone terribly wrong—or rather, horribly right. His presence at the landing has set in motion an alternate historical timeline, and now everything will be different, though not necessarily in a good way. The consequences of Lu’s mistake could prove catastrophic for every living soul on Earth, now and forever, unless the past and the future are somehow repaired—and that is a burden destined to fall on the shoulders of visionary NASA scientist and wannabe science fiction author Dr. David Zachary Murphy. An expansion of his Hugo Award–winning novella “ ‘. . . Where Angels Fear to Tread,’ ” Allen Steele’s Time Loves a Hero is at once thrilling, surprising, startling, and thoughtful—a mind-blowing masterwork of speculative fiction that radically reimagines time travel, alien contact, alternate history, and a host of other well-worn science fiction tropes.",['Fiction'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Fiction']",scifi,QoC8BwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

They're Here!,"Hank Davis, Sean CW Korsgaard",162579925X,9781625799258,2023,Baen Books,304,0.0,0,"THE ALIENS ARE AMONG US! “Where is everybody?” Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi once asked after a discussion about the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. To sum up the Fermi Paradox, if the billions of stars in our galaxy have planets with intelligent life on them, why hasn’t anyone visited us? But maybe they have, and we just haven’t noticed—and that’s the way they want it. And if they are here in secret, why are they here? Are they tourists? Anthropologists, perhaps? Or journalists sending stories back about the quaint habits of the primitives? Or maybe the extraterrestrial equivalent of hunters or fishermen? (Any odd disappearances in your neighborhood lately?) An enemy already within the gates? Or a refugee seeking sanctuary? Gourmets looking for exotic foreign food? Alien criminals hiding out? Alien cops looking for those alien criminals? No missionaries—at least not yet—and there doesn’t seem to be a Galactic Peace Corps. They might happen to look close enough to human to pass, or they might be masters of disguise. Or they might be so incomprehensibly different that we don’t even notice that they’re here. The secret visitors are revealed by such luminaries as Larry Niven, Poul Anderson, Spider Robinson, William Tenn, and more. And if any alien visitors want to check out the local natives’ speculations herein, feel free. Please pay with local currency, of course. At the publisher’s request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management). Praise for previous anthologies edited by Hank Davis: About Time Troopers: ""The editors’ mastery of the military SF and time travel subgenres is evident in their thoughtful selections. Fans of literate speculative fiction will hope for more from these experts."" —Publishers Weekly Cosmic Corsairs: “Who doesn’t like space pirates? (Well, their victims I guess, but that’s beside the point.) . . . Hank Davis has a fine sense for choosing a wide mix of stories, and this book is no exception. No story is like another, yet they manage to form a whole greater than the parts. From sapient ships to piratical sibling rivalry, pirate detectives to ingenious captives seeking freedom, from alien biology to orbital mechanics, the stories share some of the same elements—pragmatic thinking, moral complexity, loyalty, and betrayal. Definitely a fun one."" —Analog In Space No One Can Hear You Scream: “[T]he 13 tales in this collection blend sf with horror to demonstrate the resiliency of both genres . . . offers strong tales by the genre’s best storytellers.” —Library Journal “[F]irst-rate science fiction, demonstrating how short stories can still entertain.” —The Galveston County Daily News A Cosmic Christmas 2 You: “This creative and sprightly Christmas science fiction anthology spins in some surprising directions. . . . A satisfying read for cold winter evenings . . . a great stocking stuffer for SF fans.” —Publishers Weekly As Time Goes By: “As Time Goes By . . . does an excellent job of exploring not only romance through time travel—relationships enabled or imperiled by voyaging through time—but the intrinsic romance of time travel itself. . . . The range of styles and approaches is as wide as the authors' sensibilities and periods might suggest . . . full of entertaining and poignant stories . . . ” —Alvaro Zinos-Amaro, IntergalacticMedicineShow.com About Star Destroyers, coedited by Christopher Ruocchio: “. . . spectacular space battles and alien contacts . . . themes of military ethics, the uses of artificial intelligence, and the limits of the capacity of the human mind. . . . it is the human interactions and decisions that ultimately drive the stories. . . . will appeal to fans of military and hard science fiction and any readers fascinated by the possibilities of space travel."" —Booklist “. . . stories of giant spaceships at war, at peace, and in the often-gray areas between. . . . a worthy addition to a long tradition of ship-based fiction, and its authors portray captains, arcane astrogators, and civilian child passengers with equal depth. It’s recommended for fans of military SF and space adventure."" —Publishers Weekly “. . . you’d probably expect some tight, action-filled space opera stories of giant space battles . . . and there’s some of that. But there are also espionage stories, rescue missions, political conflicts, alternate histories, even a few humorous tales. . . . each author took the premise in a different direction . . . if I had to identify one common feature to all the stories, it would be that they’re all fun. . . .

It is the Quadrail—a miracle of design that connects all twelve of the galaxy’s inhabited empires, allowing diverse alien species and cultures to exchange ideas, inspire imaginations, build bridges of understanding . . . and orchestrate the subjugation of all living things. Night Train to Rigel: Frank Compton used to be an operative for Western Allied Intelligence. Then he blew the whistle on some shady dealings and got himself fired. Nowadays he just wants to lay low and let someone else do the galaxy’s dirty work. Unfortunately, no one does dirty work quite like Frank. And the robotic alien Spiders who maintain the Quadrail know it—which is why he’s going to work for them whether he likes it or not. The Third Lynx: After barely surviving his last mission, Compton just wants to relax with his gorgeous half-human partner, Bayta. But their reverie aboard the Quadrail is broken by a persistent human going on about alien artifacts. Then someone shuts him up permanently, and what begins as a murder leads Compton to uncover a conspiracy that threatens to engulf the entire galaxy. Odd Girl Out: Finally back on Earth, Compton is confronted in his apartment by a woman demanding that he rescue her ten-year-old sister. He brusquely shows her the door, only to be accused of her murder the next day. Determined to make things right, he heads to the world of New Tigris to find the little girl. But his adversaries, the mind-enslaving Mohdri, are waiting for him there. Together in a single volume, here are the first three books in the Quadrail series from a writer New York Times–bestselling author Kevin J. Anderson calls “a master of tactics [who] puts his own edge on complex hard-SF thrillers.”",['Fiction'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Fiction']",scifi,UnE9DwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

A woman seeking the power to see the evil hiding within others regrets receiving it. Letters written by a wizard in the past threaten a queen’s reign in the present. Competing for Earth, a human wrestler faces an alien shapeshifter in an interstellar tournament. A guide in Tibet must weigh the good of his people when asked to lead a westerner to the fabled realm of Shangri. An activist imprisoned for illegal genetic modification works with the materials at hand and the threads of the multiverse to make the world—a world, at least—a better place. A demonic agent sent to help a human turns the tables on his summoner. Like the “cabinets of curiosities” created by collectors of the sixteenth century, Shapers of Worlds Volume II displays a varied array of thought-provoking delights: tales of humour and sorrow, darkness and light, and hope and despair that are full of adventure, full of life, and sometimes full of regret. There are stories set in alternate histories, in possible futures, near and far, and in the here-and-now, taking place on Earth, on distant planets, or in fantastic realms.

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005-2008,Lawrence Goldman,0199671540,9780199671540,2013,"Oxford University Press, USA",1253,0.0,0,"Who made modern Britain? This book, drawn from the award-winning Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, tells the story of our recent past through the lives of those who shaped national life. Following on from the Oxford DNB's first supplement volume-noteworthy people who died between 2001 and 2004-this new volume offers biographies of more than 850 men and women who left their mark on twentieth and twenty-first century Britain, and who died in the years 2005 to 2008. Here are the people responsible for major developments in national life: from politics, the arts, business, technology, and law to military service, sport, education, science, and medicine. Many are closely connected to specific periods in Britain's recent history. From the 1950s, the young Harold Pinter or the Yorkshire cricketer, Fred Trueman, for example. From the Sixties, the footballer George Best, photographer Patrick Lichfield, and the Pink Floyd musician, Syd Barrett. It's hard to look back to the 1970s without thinking of Edward Heath and James Callaghan, who led the country for seven years in that turbulent decade; or similarly Freddie Laker, pioneer of budget air travel, and the comedians Ronnie Barker and Dave Allen who entertained with their sketch shows and sit coms. A decade later you probably browsed in Anita Roddick's Body Shop, or danced to the music of Factory Records, established by the Manchester entrepreneur, Tony Wilson. In the 1990s you may have hoped that 'Things can only get better' with a New Labour government which included Robin Cook and Mo Mowlam. Many in this volume are remembered for lives dedicated to a profession or cause: Bill Deedes or Conor Cruise O'Brien in journalism; Ned Sherrin in broadcasting or, indeed, Ted Heath whose political career spanned more than 50 years. Others were responsible for discoveries or innovations of lasting legacy and benefit-among them the epidemiologist Richard Doll, who made the link between smoking and lung cancer, Cicely Saunders, creator of the hospice movement, and Chad Varah, founder of the Samaritans. With John Profumo-who gave his name to a scandal-policeman Malcolm Fewtrell-who investigated the Great Train Robbery-or the Russian dissident Aleksandr Litvinenko-who was killed in London in 2006-we have individuals best known for specific moments in our recent past. Others are synonymous with popular objects and experiences evocative of recent decades: Mastermind with Magnus Magnusson, the PG-Tips chimpanzees trained by Molly Badham, John DeLorean's 'gull-wing' car, or the new British Library designed by Colin St John Wilson-though, as rounded and balanced accounts, Oxford DNB biographies also set these events in the wider context of a person's life story. Authoritative and accessible, the biographies in this volume are written by specialist authors, many of them leading figures in their field. Here you will find Michael Billington on Harold Pinter, Michael Crick on George Best, Richard Davenport-Hines on Anita Roddick, Brenda Hale on Rose Heilbron, Roy Hattersley on James Callaghan, Simon Heffer on John Profumo, Douglas Hurd on Edward Heath, Alex Jennings on Paul Scofield, Hermione Lee on Pat Kavanagh, Geoffrey Wheatcroft on Conor Cruise O'Brien, and Peregrine Worsthorne on Bill Deedes. Many in this volume are, naturally, household names. But a good number are also remembered for lives away from the headlines. What in the 1980s became 'Thatcherism' owed much to behind the scenes advice from Ralph Harris and Alfred Sherman; children who learned to read with Ladybird Books must thank their creator, Douglas Keen; while, without its first producer, Verity Lambert, there would have been no Doctor Who. Others are 'ordinary' people capable of remarkable acts. Take, for instance, Arthur Bywater who over two days in 1944 cleared thousands of bombs from a Liverpool munitions factory following an explosion-only to do the same, months later, in an another factory. Awarded the George Cross and the George Medal, Bywater remains the only non-combatant to have received Britain's two highest awards for civilian bravery.",['Biography & Autobiography'],"['Science Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Biography & Autobiography']",scifi,nbGcAQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

In reality, the US plans to send the family to a secret facility on the moon where they will be placed into a state of hibernation for three months and have information and training fed directly to their brains. If successful, the family's mission would pave the way for the future of space exploration, travel, and even habitation. The MacMurchaid family, which consists of father Robert, mother Denise, and children Tony, Troy, Kris, and Nicole, is suddenly thrust into the spotlight when they are chosen for the mission of being the first family sent into space. Their training and their trip into space-as detailed in this book and supplemented with real-life historical space program tidbits-go smoothly. But soon after the family members are placed into hibernation on the moon, war breaks out on Earth, and the family is abandoned and presumed dead. The MacMurchaids awake over 455 years later, facing a new world and new challenges. Will the knowledge and training they were fed during hibernation allow them to overcome these challenges? Read and find out. ABOUT THE AUTHOR ROBERT E. MURCHISON was born and mostly raised in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Growing up, his parents and grandparents taught him to appreciate family and history, which are themes that play out in his writing. The main characters in Robert's novel A Family of Time: A Space Exploration Science Fiction Novel are based on his four children and his late wife, who encouraged him to write the book. He and his children are registered members of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. And Robert is a veteran of the United States Air Force, where he served as a launch crew member for the Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

Katherine Hayles describes as ""this enormously ambitious posthumous volume,"" renowned scholar George Slusser offers a definitive version of the argument about the history of science fiction that he developed throughout his career: that several important ideas and texts, routinely overlooked in other critical studies, made significant contributions to the creation of modern science fiction as it developed into a truly global literature. He explores how key thinkers like René Descartes, Benjamin Constant, Thomas DeQuincey, Guy du Maupassant, J.D. Bernal, and Ralph Waldo Emerson influenced and are reflected in twentieth-century science fiction stories from the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Poland, and Russia. The conclusion begins with Slusser’s overview of global science fiction in the twenty-first century and discusses recent developments in countries like China, Romania, and Israel. Hayles’s foreword provides a useful summation of the book’s contents, while science fiction writer Gregory Benford contributes an afterword providing a personal perspective on the life and thoughts of his longtime friend.

The Time Machines: The Pulp Era of Science Fiction,Pasquale De Marco,,,2025,Pasquale De Marco,161,0.0,0,"In the early days of the 20th century, the pulp magazines emerged as a new and exciting medium for science fiction. These magazines were filled with stories of adventure, exploration, and the future. They were a way for readers to escape from the everyday world and dream of a better tomorrow. One of the most influential pulp magazines was Amazing Stories, founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1926. Gernsback was a visionary editor who believed that science fiction could be a force for good in the world. He published some of the greatest science fiction writers of the day, including Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and Arthur C. Clarke. The pulp magazines had a profound impact on the development of science fiction. They helped to popularize the genre and bring it to a wider audience. They also helped to create a sense of community among science fiction fans. In the 1950s, the pulp magazines began to decline in popularity.

The past decade has seen an extraordinary laboratory-building boom. This new crop of laboratories features spectacular architecture and resort-like amenities. The buildings sprawl luxuriously on verdant campuses or sit sleekly in expensive urban neighborhoods. Designed to attract venture capital, generous philanthropy, and star scientists, these laboratories are meant to create the ideal conditions for scientific discovery. Yet there is little empirical evidence that shows if they do. Laboratory Lifestyles examines this new species of scientific laboratory from architectural, economic, social, and scientific perspectives. Generously illustrated with photographs of laboratories and scientists at work in them, the book investigates how “lifestyle science” affects actual science. Are scientists working when they stretch in a yoga class, play volleyball in the company tournament, chat in an on-site café, or show off their facilities to visiting pharmaceutical executives? The book describes, among other things, the role of beanbag chairs in the construction of science at Xerox PARC; the Southern California vibe of the RAND Corporation (Malibu), General Atomic (La Jolla), and Hughes Research Laboratories (Malibu); and Biosphere 2's “bionauts” as both scientists and scientific subjects; and interstellar laboratories. Laboratory Lifestyles (the title is an allusion to Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar's influential Laboratory Life) documents a shift in what constitutes scientific practice; these laboratories and their lifestyles are as experimental as the science they cultivate.

Prisoner of Infinity,Jasun Horsley,1911597124,9781911597124,2018,Aeon Books,403,0.0,0,"Prisoner of Infinity examines modern-day accounts of UFOs, alien abductions, and psychism to uncover a century-long program of psychological fragmentation, collective indoctrination, and covert cultural, social, and mythic engineering.Whether it is the forces of God, government, aliens from outer (or inner) space, or the incalculable effects of childhood sexual trauma on the human psyche, premature contact with these forces compels us to create ""crucial fictions."" Such semi-coherent mythic narratives make partial sense out of our experience, but in the process turn us into the unreliable narrators of our own lives.Taking UFOS and the work of ""experiencer"" Whitley Strieber as its departure point, Prisoner of Infinity explores how beliefs are created and perceptions are managed in the face of the inexplicably complex forces of our existence. While keeping the question of a non-human and/or paranormal element open, the book maps how all-too-human agendas (such as the CIA's MK Ultra program) have co-opted the ancient psychological process of myth-making, giving rise to dissociative, dumbed-down Hollywood versions of reality. The New Age movement, UFOs, alien abductions, psychism, psychedelic mind expansion, Transhumanism, the Space Program - what if they are all productions devised by committee in dark rooms to serve social, political, and economic goals that are largely devoid of true substance or meaning? Through an exacting and enlivening process of social, cultural and psychological examination and excavation, Prisoner of Infinity uncovers the most deeply buried treasure of all.

A mutilated corpse has been found along Interstate 75 between Kentucky and Tennessee, and the body parts might belong to Julia Winchell. Eight years earlier, when Julia was a student at the University of Cincinnati, she witnessed a murder. When the body disappeared, no one believed her. But Julia never forgot it, and was compiling notes and articles that would point the finger at a shocking suspect. District Attorney Gabe Caplan is Cincinnati's golden boy—a champion of the underdog, a defender of law and order, and a man shadowed by a tragic past. Eight years ago, his pregnant wife was brutally murdered, leaving behind their two-year-old daughter. Now Gabe is on the verge of scoring a major victory in a high-profile case.

Pseudoscience and Science Fiction,Andrew May,3319426052,9783319426051,2016,Springer,188,0.0,0,"Aliens, flying saucers, ESP, the Bermuda Triangle, antigravity ... are we talking about science fiction or pseudoscience? Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference. Both pseudoscience and science fiction (SF) are creative endeavours that have little in common with academic science, beyond the superficial trappings of jargon and subject matter. The most obvious difference between the two is that pseudoscience is presented as fact, not fiction. Yet like SF, and unlike real science, pseudoscience is driven by a desire to please an audience – in this case, people who “want to believe”. This has led to significant cross-fertilization between the two disciplines. SF authors often draw on “real” pseudoscientific theories to add verisimilitude to their stories, while on other occasions pseudoscience takes its cue from SF – the symbiotic relationship between ufology and Hollywood being a prime example of this. This engagingly written, well researched and richly illustrated text explores a wide range of intriguing similarities and differences between pseudoscience and the fictional science found in SF. Andrew May has a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University and a PhD in astrophysics from Manchester University. After many years in academia and the private sector, he now works as a freelance writer and scientific consultant. He has written pocket biographies of Newton and Einstein, as well as contributing to a number of popular science books.

Cultural Capitalism,Bradley A. Gorski,1501779818,9781501779817,2025,Cornell University Press,337,0.0,0,"Cultural Capitalism explores Russian literature's eager embrace of capitalism in the post-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union fell, books were suddenly bought and sold as commodities. Russia's first bestseller lists brought attention and prestige. Even literary prizes turned to the market for legitimacy. The rise of capitalism entirely transformed both the economics and the aesthetics of Russian literature. By reconstructing the market's influence on everything from late-Soviet paper shortages to the prose of neoimperialism, Cultural Capitalism reveals Russian literature's exuberant hopes for and deep disappointments in capitalism. Only a free market, it was hoped, could cure endemic book deficits and liberate literature from ideological constraints. But as the market came to dominate literature, it imposed an ideology of its own, one that directed literary development for decades. Through archival research, original interviews, and provocative readings of literary texts, Bradley A. Gorski immerses the reader in both the economic and aesthetic worlds of post-Soviet Russian literature to reveal a cultural logic dominated by capitalism. The Russian 1990s and early 2000s saw markets introduced, adopted, and debated at an accelerated pace, all against the backdrop of a socialist past, staging the polemics between capitalism and culture in high drama and sharp relief. But the market forces at the center of the post-Soviet transition are fundamental to cultural trends worldwide. By revealing the complexities of Russia's story, Cultural Capitalism mounts a critique that cuts across national borders and provides a new way of seeing culture in the post-1989 era worldwide.",['History'],"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'History']",romance,4_wvEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

When the computer was asked to “blindly” select the most likely bestsellers out of 5,000 books published over the past thirty years based only on theme, it discovered two possible candidates: The Accident by Danielle Steel and The Associate by John Grisham. The computer recognized quantifiable patterns in their seemingly opposite, but undeniably successful writing careers with legal thrillers and romance.

It is time to question the cultural capital of traditional archetypes, explore the experience of romance readers, and question how romance and cultural studies researchers create quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research. This work centers around a data set collected with a revised version of Janice Radway’s Reading the Romance survey that will be shared with all the authors of this anthology. By having access to this pool, authors will have the opportunity to explore different elements of reader experience and cultural norms in romance fiction, and potentially reflect on changes since Janice Radway’s seminal work. The norms and negotiations readers experience while consuming romance is especially interesting as romancelandia becomes a more mainstream part of popular culture with the popularity of Bridgerton and romance series like Ice Planet Barbarians exploding on BookTok. No other book in romance or popular culture studies identifies a data set as the connecting element, and to do so creates an exciting opportunity to create a more inclusive study of popular romance, offer truly interdisciplinary research on the question of how readers read romance, and generate diverse areas of future scholarship. This edited volume explores multiple issues in romance fiction, based on survey data from real romance readers. An updated version of Janice Radway’s influential survey looking at romance readers in the early 1980s, this time scholars explore romance readers’ habits and attitudes in the twenty-first century.

Having sold over seventy million copies worldwide since 2011, E. L. James’s lurid series about a sexual ingénue and the powerful young entrepreneur who introduces her to BDSM sex has ingrained itself in our collective consciousness. But why have these particular novels—poorly written and formulaic as they are—become so popular, especially among women over thirty? In this concise, engaging book, Eva Illouz subjects the Fifty Shades cultural phenomenon to the serious scrutiny it has been begging for. After placing the trilogy in the context of best-seller publishing, she delves into its remarkable appeal, seeking to understand the intense reading pleasure it provides and how that resonates with the structure of relationships between men and women today. Fifty Shades, Illouz argues, is a gothic romance adapted to modern times in which sexuality is both a source of division between men and women and a site to orchestrate their reconciliation. As for the novels’ notorious depictions of bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism, Illouz shows that these are as much a cultural fantasy as a sexual one, serving as a guide to a happier romantic life. The Fifty Shades trilogy merges romantic fantasy with self-help guide—two of the most popular genres for female readers. Offering a provocative explanation for the success and popularity of the Fifty Shades of Grey novels, Hard-Core Romance is an insightful look at modern relationships and contemporary women’s literature.",['Social Science'],"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Social Science']",romance,ktJoAwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

"The Novel, Volume 1",Franco Moretti,0691243751,9780691243757,2022,Princeton University Press,926,0.0,0,"Nearly as global in its ambition and sweep as its subject, Franco Moretti's The Novel is a watershed event in the understanding of the first truly planetary literary form. A translated selection from the epic five-volume Italian Il Romanzo (2001-2003), The Novel's two volumes are a unified multiauthored reference work, containing more than one hundred specially commissioned essays by leading contemporary critics from around the world. Providing the first international comparative reassessment of the novel, these essential volumes reveal the form in unprecedented depth and breadth--as a great cultural, social, and human phenomenon that stretches from the ancient Greeks to today, where modernity itself is unimaginable without the genre. By viewing the novel as much more than an aesthetic form, this landmark collection demonstrates how the genre has transformed human emotions and behavior, and the very perception of reality. Historical, statistical, and formal analyses show the novel as a complex literary system, in which new forms proliferate in every period and place. Volume 1: History, Geography, and Culture, looks at the novel mostly from the outside, treating the transition from oral to written storytelling and the rise of narrative and fictionality, and covering the ancient Greek novel, the novel in premodern China, the early Spanish novel, and much else, including readings of novels from around the world. These books will be essential reading for all students and scholars of literature.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Literary Criticism']",romance,oDxZEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
People's Choice Literature,Tom Comitta,0231562616,9780231562614,2025,Columbia University Press,476,0.0,0,"What do Americans truly want in a novel? What would it look like if their preferences and aversions materialized in book form? In People’s Choice Literature, Tom Comitta has taken up this challenge, writing two groundbreaking novels based on a nationwide poll about literary taste—one featuring the story elements Americans most desire and another containing everything Americans despise. The Most Wanted Novel is a fast-paced thriller evoking page-turners by Dan Brown, David Baldacci, and Janet Evanovich. It follows a California woman pulled into a tech tycoon’s apocalyptic ambitions after her brother’s kidnapping, teaming up with a hunky FBI agent with a tragic past. The Most Unwanted Novel is a genre-bending doorstopper: an epistolary Christmas novel set on a near-future Mars, where elderly aristocratic tennis players scour the globe for lost love, venturing from the coldest of arctic wastelands to the darkest caverns of the macabre. Variously recalling Kathy Acker, César Aira, and Philip K. Dick, it features sentient robots, talking animals, and a hundred-page collection of horror stories. People’s Choice Literature is inspired by the artists Komar and Melamid, who created two now-infamous paintings based on opinion polling. A similar experiment by Dave Soldier produced “The Most Wanted Song” and “The Most Unwanted Song.” Comitta has adapted these methods to fiction, drawing on readers’ preferences about everything from genre to verb tense to characters’ identity, and incorporating machine learning data and passages written in collaboration with a large language model. Audacious and shockingly entertaining, People’s Choice Literature also asks big questions about taste, authorship, and the notion of “good writing.”",['Literary Criticism'],"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Literary Criticism']",romance,dsovEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Fate drives him to protect her come what may. Then love takes a hand in this battle of yearning hearts, stubborn wills, and a match too powerful to deny. #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Laurens returns to rugged Scotland with a dramatic tale of passionate desire and unwavering devotion. Restless and impatient, Marcus Cynster waits for Fate to come calling. He knows his destiny lies in the lands surrounding his family home, but what will his future be? Equally importantly, with whom will he share it? Of one fact he feels certain: his fated bride will not be Niniver Carrick. His elusive neighbor attracts him mightily, yet he feels compelled to protect her—even from himself. Fickle Fate, he’s sure, would never be so kind as to decree that Niniver should be his. The best he can do for them both is to avoid her. Niniver has vowed to return her clan to prosperity. The epitome of fragile femininity, her delicate and ethereal exterior cloaks a stubborn will and an unflinching devotion to the people in her care. She accepts that in order to achieve her goal, she cannot risk marrying and losing control of the clan’s reins to an inevitably controlling husband. Unfortunately, too many local men see her as their opportunity. Soon, she’s forced to seek help to get rid of her unwelcome suitors. Powerful and dangerous, Marcus Cynster is perfect for the task. Suppressing her wariness over tangling with a gentleman who so excites her passions, she appeals to him for assistance with her peculiar problem. Although at first he resists, Marcus discovers that, contrary to his expectations, his fated role is to stand by Niniver’s side and, ultimately, to claim her hand.

When a middle-aged spinster is found strangled in her country cottage and scurrilous gossip implicates Henry, Lord Glossup, he appeals to Barnaby and Penelope Adair along with Inspector Stokes to unravel the mystery of who killed Viola Huntingdon. Henry, Lord Glossup, arrives on Barnaby and Penelope Adairs’ doorstep and begs their aid—and that of Stokes—in identifying the murderer of Viola Huntingdon, a middle-aged spinster who lived a largely blameless life in a country cottage in a tiny village close to Henry’s home. As Stokes has already been tapped to take the case, the investigators travel to Salisbury and thence to Ashmore village and throw themselves into the case. While initially Henry was touted as a suspect, he is quickly eliminated, and with the help of the victim’s sister, Madeline, the investigators set out to discover all they can about the victim and who might have wished her ill. In such a small village, with a commensurately small population, the list of possible suspects is short, but the existence of Viola’s ‘secret admirer, H’ has everyone stumped. First, how could Viola, living in such a small community, have had a secret visitor, a man no one saw except at a distance? And who on earth is he, this H? As the investigators piece together the clues of missing jewelry and sightings of H and follow the leads generated by opportunistic thieves, dodgy jewelers, and local moneylenders, a picture emerges that points to only one conclusion. But in small villages, things are rarely as they seem. Have the investigators got the right man in their sights, or have they been led astray?

The Games Lovers Play,Stephanie Laurens,1925559459,9781925559453,2021,Savdek Management Proprietary Limited,419,0.0,0,"#1 New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Laurens returns to the Cynsters’ next generation with an evocative tale of two people striving to overcome unusual hurdles in order to claim true love. A nobleman wedded to the lady he loves strives to overwrite five years of masterful pretence and open his wife’s eyes to the fact that he loves her as much as she loves him. Lord Devlin Cader, Earl of Alverton, married Therese Cynster five years ago. What he didn’t tell her then and has assiduously hidden ever since—for what seemed excellent reasons at the time—is that he loves her every bit as much as she loves him. For her own misguided reasons, Therese had decided that the adage that Cynsters always marry for love did not necessarily mean said Cynsters were loved in return. She accepted that was usually so, but being universally viewed by gentlemen as too managing, bossy, and opinionated, she believed she would never be loved for herself. Consequently, after falling irrevocably in love with Devlin, when he made it plain he didn’t love her yet wanted her to wife, she accepted the half love-match he offered, and once they were wed, set about organizing to make their marriage the very best it could be. Now, five years later, they are an established couple within the haut ton, have three young children, and Devlin is making a name for himself in business and political circles. There’s only one problem. Having attended numerous Cynster weddings and family gatherings and spent time with Therese’s increasingly married cousins, who with their spouses all embrace the Cynster ideal of marriage based on mutually acknowledged love, Devlin is no longer content with the half love-match he himself engineered. No fool, he sees and comprehends what the craven act of denying his love is costing both him and Therese and feels compelled to rectify his fault. He wants for them what all Therese’s married cousins enjoy—the rich and myriad benefits of marriages based on acknowledged mutual love. Love, he’s discovered, is too powerful a force to deny, leaving him wrestling with the conundrum of finding a way to convincingly reveal to Therese that he loves her without wrecking everything—especially the mutual trust—they’ve built over the past five years. A classic historical romance set amid the glittering world of the London haut ton. A Cynster Next Generation novel—a full-length historical romance of 110,000 words.

Sounds so romantic, with visions of cuddling before a roaring fire, hot chocolate spiked with brandy, and a secret elopement. Wait. What? My fiancé’s father won’t stop trying to turn our pending wedding into a three-ring media circus so he can get free publicity for his family’s Fortune 500 company. My mother has decided she’s done with All Things Wedding and asks her teacup Chihuahua for mother-of-the-bride advice. They’ve all gone certifiably mad. Then the stress from the wedding puts my mother in the hospital, I scream at my future father-in-law in front of a camera crew and the video goes viral, and the romantic wedding that started with Andrew’s grand Pride and Prejudice proposal looks less like Jane Austen and more like Dostoyevsky. So what do you do when you’re a fixer and you can’t fix something? You give up on it. Not on Andrew, silly. The wedding. Shopping for a CEO’s Wife is the next book in Julia Kent’s New York Times bestselling Shopping series. As Shannon and Declan enjoy their newlywed bliss, Andrew’s father wants to exploit Amanda and Andrew’s nuptials, much to Amanda’s chagrin.

We live in an era when book clubs, bibliomemoirs, Bookstagram and BookTok are as valuable to some readers as solitary reading moments. The product of nearly two decades of qualitative research into readers and reading culture, What Readers Do examines reading through three dimensions - aesthetic conduct, moral conduct, and self-care – to show how readers intertwine private and social behaviors, and both reinforce and oppose the structures of capitalism. Analyzing reading as a post-digital practice that is a synthesis of both print and digital modes and on- and offline behaviors, Driscoll presents a methodology for studying readers that connects book history, literary studies, sociology, and actor-network theory. Arguing for the vitality, agency, and creativity of readers, this book sheds light on how we read now - and on how much more readers do than just read.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,IqXuEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family. What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder. Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the home’s cameras, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman. It was everything. She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means.

A Hollywood has-been, Sarah Lai’s dreams of success behind the camera have turned to ashes.

This is her last chance to tell her side of the story and maybe even exact belated vengeance. As Sarah recounts the industry’s dark and sordid secrets, however, she begins to realize that she has a few sins of her own to confess. Now she must confront her choices and ask herself, just who was complicit? Bold and hypnotic, Complicit transports us “into the film industry’s dark and deep-seated culture of rampant sexism and unbridled male ego…and the terrible cost of staying silent.

Big hair and bigger lies collide in the highly anticipated follow-up to Young Rich Widows, where nothing's more dangerous than a widow with nothing left to lose. Set in neon-drenched Providence, Rhode Island, circa 1987, just two years after a plane carrying four mafia-affiliated law-firm partners exploded over the Atlantic along with the cushy lives of their once wealthy wives. Now, Krystle fights to keep their fallen law firm afloat. Justine hustles as a lawyer-in-training. Meredith owns and operates the strip club where she once danced. And Camille orchestrates honey-pot schemes for scorned women–until one of her arrangements goes terribly wrong, and she becomes implicated in the debauched Mayor Tom's mysterious murder in the champagne room. With everything on the line, the widows must join forces once more. But as the conspiracy unravels beyond the mayor's demise, their search for justice pits first wife against second wife and widow against widow. With the widows' fragile bond now tested, will the women cement their friendships, or is loyalty a luxury they just can't afford? In this thrilling expansion of the Widows universe, brimming with sloshed champagne, smeared lipstick, and lethal secrets, Desperate Deadly Widows unfolds as an edge-of-your-seat thriller where desperation wears stilettos, trust is a poker chip, and redemption comes at the cost of everything you thought you knew.",['Fiction'],['Thriller'],thriller,kf0gEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Now, thirty years later, private detective Kate Marshall has been approached by a true crime podcast producer with an intriguing question they need her help answering: What if Janey was killed by Peter Conway, the notorious Nine Elms Cannibal? The contract would be the most lucrative of Kate’s career, but it comes with a price of its own, dredging up a sordid, complicated past that she would sooner forget . . . one that the paparazzi are determined to keep in the headlines.

In specific cases where the novels to be translated include different wordplays, codes, and symbols, the problem of quality and acceptability has become more challenging for translators due to the significant impact of these language-specific components on the plot and the technical linguistic limitations. This book aims to show different methods for overcoming this challenge in translation by elaborating on the theoretical aspects of “creativity” in translation and by analyzing the dimensions of this creativity through the examples selected from Dan Brown’s bestseller thriller novels. The book consists of three chapters. The first chapter gives detailed information on popular literature, its specific characteristics, subgenres, translational methods for popular literature, and creativity in translation. The second chapter focuses on the theoretical aspects of the issue of “creativity” in the translation of popular literature. Finally, the third chapter elaborates on numerous examples of wordplays, symbols, and codes for which translators have used their creative skills in the translation process. The significance of the creative interventions of translators is concretely demonstrated through the analysis of these examples. The methods and the examples of creativity discussed here will show the way for future translators of popular literary works to overcome the problem of the “untranslatability” of wordplays, codes, and symbols.

That was the largest collection of new Holmes stories ever assembled, and originally planned to be a one-time event. But readers wanted more, and the contributors had more stories from Watson's Tin Dispatch Box, so the fun continued. Now, with the release of Parts XIX, XX, and XXI, the series has grown to over 450 new Holmes adventures by nearly 200 contributors from around the world. Since the beginning, all contributor royalties go to the Stepping Stones School for special needs children at Undershaw, one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's former homes, and to date the project has raised nearly $60,000 for the school. As has become the tradition, this new collection of 64 adventures features Holmes and Watson carrying out their masterful investigations from the early days of their friendship in Baker Street to the post-War years during Holmes's retirement. Along the way they are involved in some fascinating mysteries - some relating Untold Cases, others sequels to Canonical adventures, and a number progressing along completely unexpected lines. Join us as we return to Baker Street and discover more authentic adventures of Sherlock Holmes, described by the estimable Dr. Watson as ""the best and wisest ... whom I have ever known.""

Soundscapes of Liberation,Celeste Day Moore,1478021993,9781478021995,2021,Duke University Press,211,0.0,0,"In Soundscapes of Liberation, Celeste Day Moore traces the popularization of African American music in postwar France, where it signaled new forms of power and protest. Moore surveys a wide range of musical genres, soundscapes, and media: the US military's wartime records and radio programs; the French record industry's catalogs of blues, jazz, and R&B recordings; the translations of jazz memoirs; a provincial choir specializing in spirituals; and US State Department-produced radio programs that broadcast jazz and gospel across the French empire. In each of these contexts, individual intermediaries such as educators, producers, writers, and radio deejays imbued African American music with new meaning, value, and political power. Their work resonated among diverse Francophone audiences and transformed the lives and labor of many African American musicians, who found financial and personal success as well as discrimination in France. By showing how the popularity of African American music was intertwined with contemporary structures of racism and imperialism, Moore demonstrates this music's centrality to postwar France and the convergence of decolonization, the expanding globalized economy, the Cold War, and worldwide liberation movements.",['Music'],['Thriller'],thriller,q74-EAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

She assumes it will be routine, a scene like many other accidents she's covered. She's wrong. The accident gives Nichelle a chance glimpse of an ongoing conspiracy. But proveable facts are fleeting. And as Nichelle digs deeper into the case, people and evidence begin to disappear. Someone is one step ahead of her, desperate to cover their tracks. A master criminal with a deadly secret, who will stop at nothing to keep the truth hidden... But as she draws closer to unraveling the mystery of two dead cops, Nichelle realizes she's become the next target. Can she survive this murderous game of cat and mouse long enough to solve the mystery? Or will Nichelle fall prey to a killer? _________________________ Book 2: Buried Leads When an Armani-clad body turns up in a shallow forest grave, Nichelle Clarke is the first reporter on the scene. She soon discovers the victim is a tobacco lobbyist with powerful connections. Local politicians are pushing for a quick arrest. Nichelle thinks they seem nervous. Even more so after a second victim is found dead. Nichelle's search for the killer soon uncovers a jaw-dropping trail of malfeasance and debauchery that stretches all the way to Washington, D.C. It's the kind of story that can make a crime reporter's career. But the power players at the center of this conspiracy have everything to lose, and as Nichelle's quest for the truth nears its end, she lands squarely in the crosshairs of the killer. Can her wits alone can get her out alive, or will these secrets stay buried for good? _________________________ Book 3: Small Town Spin T.J. had the world in the palm of his hand. He was handsome. Popular in school. Smart. A stellar athlete. The son of superstar pro quarterback Tony Okerson, he seemed destined to follow in his father's footsteps to a career of gridiron glory. That bright, shining dream ends when T.J.'s lifeless body is found on a rocky shoreline near his family's Chesapeake Bay home. But as Nichelle begins to explore the facts surrounding the death, she discovers some shocking details. Something doesn't fit. And while the local sheriff wants to stamp the case a drug overdose and move on, Nichelle becomes convinced that foul play may have been involved. To the townsfolk, Nichelle is an outsider, putting her nose where it doesn't belong. But in her experience, that's exactly where the most damning secrets are kept. And the further she follows the evidence trail, the more Nichelle realizes that this sleepy coastal village is anything but innocent... _________________________",['Fiction'],['Thriller'],thriller,zReAzQEACAAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Haunted but determined, Maya must make sense of challenging research, betrayal, and conflicting loyalties in a desperate race to detect how disease outbreaks are spreading and whether they can be stopped. This is an ebook collection of the first four novels in the MayaVerse, a public health world centered on Maya Maguire at the start of her career with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A statistics nerd adopted as an infant from China, raised in the U.S. Southwest, and damaged by a childhood accident, she struggles to find her place. She’s obsessed with achievement and allegiance to her colleagues as she fights microbial threats, including bacteria (anthrax and Borrelia) and viruses (COVID‑19 and dengue). The combined stories follow a diverse cast of epidemiologists, veterinarians, and public health officials navigating ethical dilemmas during global and local disease investigations across multiple locales—from Arizona and New Mexico to Hawaii and international settings in Europe, Africa, and China. At its core, the novels are about human resilience and the struggle to balance grief with the urgent need to protect public health in a disrupted world. The central theme is the interplay between human fragility and tenacity in the face of relentless, large‐scale disease challenges. The narrative explores how characters navigate despair, guilt, and trauma while confronting the uncertainties of modern disease outbreaks and scientific dilemmas. The story repeatedly emphasizes that even amidst global and private calamities, the search for truth, connection, and a sense of purpose persist. The collection is a medical thriller combined with elements of mystery, suspense, romance, and contemporary fiction. It will appeal to readers of Michael Crichton, Robin Cook, and James Patterson, who integrate science within a suspenseful narrative. It also will be of interest to readers who enjoy international and multicultural settings, given the story’s global scope, and those in fields such as infectious diseases, wildlife conservation, bio-engineering, and public health policy. Unlike standard thrillers, this collection interweaves intimate character relationships, family dynamics, and professional dilemmas in public health, appealing to both “hard science” readers and those favoring emotionally rich narratives.

A - I've enjoyed thought-provoking medical or science-based fiction ever since I was old enough to read Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain and Robin Cook's Coma. I'm also a big fan of the modern-day thriller writers like Craig Martelle, Michael Anderle, and Tess Gerritsen.So I've been writing these new medical thrillers as a unique mix of the two kinds of books. Epidemiologist Leigh Austen encounters similarly apocalyptic threats...and she does in a world rife with international skullduggery and conspiracy!Q - Why should readers give these books a try?A - Because you'll get to meet a bunch of memorable characters - scientists, soldiers, doctors, even a shadowy Nostradamus-like figure - in the midst of intriguing medical thrillers filled with action, humor and heart. (Yes, I paraphrased one of my reviewers, but I can't put it any better.)Q - Tell us more about epidemiologist Leigh Austen - what makes her tick?A - Leigh's the kind of person who'll move mountains to help someone.

Trying to find some normalcy during the Covid-19 pandemic, Brian Murphy and his family are on a summer excursion in Cape Cod when his wife, Emma, comes down with concerning flu-like symptoms. But their leisurely return home to New York City quickly becomes a race to the local hospital as she suddenly begins seizing in the car. At the ICU, she is diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis, a rare and highly lethal mosquito-borne viral disease seemingly caught during one of their evening cookouts. Complicating the situation further, Brian and Emma’s young daughter then begins to exhibit alarming physical and behavioral symptoms, too. Emma’s harrowing hospital stay becomes even more fraught when Brian receives a staggering hospital bill full of outrageous charges and murky language. To add insult to injury, his health insurance company refuses to cover any of the cost, citing dubious clauses in Brian’s policy. Forced to choose between the ongoing care of family and bills he can never pay, and furious at a shockingly indifferent healthcare system, Brian vows to seek justice. But to get to the bottom of the predatory practices targeting his loved ones and countless others, he must uncover the dark side of an industry that has strayed drastically from its altruistic roots—and bring down the callous executives preying on the sick and defenseless before the virus can claim even more people . . .",['Fiction'],['Thriller'],thriller,2zWOEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Breaking with the tradition of conceptualizing the present tense purely as a deictic category denoting synchronicity between a narrative event and its presentation, the study redefines present-tense narration as a fully-fledged narrative strategy whose functional potential far exceeds temporal relations between story and discourse. The first part of the volume presents numerous analytical categories that systematically describe the formal, structural, functional, and syntactic dimensions of present-tense usage in narrative fiction. These categories are then deployed to investigate the uses and functions of present-tense narration in selected twenty-first century novels, including Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake, Ian McEwan’s Nutshell, and Irvine Welsh’s Skagboys. The seven case studies serve to illustrate the ubiquity of present-tense narration in contemporary fiction, ranging from the historical novel to the thriller, and to investigate the various ways in which the present tense contributes to narrative worldmaking.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,mJI9EAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The history of Warner Bros. is not just the tale of a legendary film studio and its stars, but of classic Hollywood itself, as well as a portrait of America in the last century. It’s a family story of Polish-Jewish immigrants—the brothers Warner—who took advantage of new opportunities in the burgeoning film industry at a time when four mavericks could invent ways of operating, of warding off government regulation, and of keeping audiences coming back for more during some of the nation's darkest days. Innovation was key to their early success. Four years after its founding, the studio revolutionized moviemaking by introducing sound in The Jazz Singer (1927). Stars and stories gave Warner Bros. its distinct identity as the studio where tough guys like Humphrey Bogart and strong women like Bette Davis kept people on the edge of their seats. Over the years, these acclaimed actors and countless others made magic on WB’s soundstages and were responsible for such diverse classics as Casablanca, A Streetcar Named Desire, A Star Is Born, Bonnie & Clyde, Malcolm X, Caddyshack, Purple Rain, and hundreds more. It’s the studio that put noir in film with The Maltese Falcon and other classics of the genre, where the iconic Looney Tunes were unleashed on animation, and the studio that took an unpopular stance at the start of World War II by producing anti-Nazi films. Counter-culture hits like A Clockwork Orange and The Exorcist carried the studio through the 1970s and '80s. Franchise phenomena like Harry Potter, the DC universe, and more continue to shape a cinematic vision and longevity that is unparalleled in the annals of film history.

Anthropocene Antarctica,"Elizabeth Leane, Jeffrey McGee",0429770758,9780429770753,2019,Routledge,211,0.0,0,"Anthropocene Antarctica offers new ways of thinking about the ‘Continent for Science and Peace’ in a time of planetary environmental change. In the Anthropocene, Antarctica has become central to the Earth’s future. Ice cores taken from its interior reveal the deep environmental history of the planet and warming ocean currents are ominously destabilising the glaciers around its edges, presaging sea-level rise in decades and centuries to come. At the same time, proliferating research stations and tourist numbers challenge stereotypes of the continent as the ‘last wilderness.’ The Anthropocene brings Antarctica nearer in thought, entangled with our everyday actions. If the Anthropocene signals the end of the idea of Nature as separate from humans, then the Antarctic, long considered the material embodiment of this idea, faces a radical reframing. Understanding the southern polar region in the twenty-first century requires contributions across the disciplinary spectrum. This collection paves the way for researchers in the Environmental Humanities, Law and Social Sciences to engage critically with the Antarctic, fostering a community of scholars who can act with natural scientists to address the globally significant environmental issues that face this vitally important part of the planet.",['Nature'],['Thriller'],thriller,JFyvDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Cinema as a Worldbuilding Machine in the Digital Era,Alain Boillat,0861969812,9780861969814,2022,Indiana University Press,456,0.0,0,"This essay examines the primacy of worldbuilding in the age of CGI, transmedia practices and ""high concept"" fiction by studying the principles that govern the creation of a multiverse in a wide range of film and TV productions. Emphasis is placed on Hollywood sci-fi movies and their on-screen representation of imaginary machines that mirror the film medium, following in the tradition of Philip K. Dick's writings and the cyberpunk culture. A typology of worlds is established, as well as a number of analytical tools for assessing the impact of the coexistence of two or more worlds on the narrative structure, the style (uses of color, editing practices), the generic affiliation (or hybridity), the seriality and the discourse produced by a given film (particularly in fictions linked to post-9/11 fantasies). Among the various titles examined, the reader is offered a detailed analysis of the Resident Evil film series, Total Recall and its remake, Dark City, the Matrix trilogy, Avatar, Source Code and other time-loop films, TRON and its sequel, Christopher Nolan's Tenet, and several TV shows – most notably HBO's Westworld, but also Sliders, Lost, Fringe and Counterpart.",['Performing Arts'],['Thriller'],thriller,16BxEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Crime Fiction in the Caribbean,Lucy Evans,0198919905,9780198919902,2024,Oxford University Press,225,0.0,0,"Crime Fiction in the Caribbean: Reframing Crime and Justice is the first academic book to focus on crime fiction by anglophone Caribbean writers. It explores how contemporary writers experiment with the crime genre in order to convey, contextualize, and comment on crime and justice in Caribbean countries. Lucy Evans reads crime fiction as a versatile mode of writing that can be politically engaged, and that-in a Caribbean context-can expose power structures embedded in the region's multi-layered history of colonial conquest, genocide of Indigenous populations, plantation agriculture, transatlantic slavery, and indentured labour. This book covers fiction set in Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Grenada, and Haiti, discussing novels by Elizabeth Nunez, Jacob Ross, Marlon James, Harischandra Khemraj, Esther Figueroa, Edwidge Danticat, Cherie Jones, and several others. Evans considers how fiction by anglophone Caribbean writers not only reflects upon the social realities of crime and crime control in the Caribbean, but also at times contests or complicates scholarly, popular, and legal perspectives. She argues that through their engagement with the crime genre, these writers raise pressing questions about what constitutes crime and justice in a Caribbean context, and about accountability. Looking beyond the traditional focus of crime fiction and criminology on individual acts of wrongdoing, their fiction highlights systemic social harms rooted in the region's colonial past. Reading crime fiction through the lens of criminological research, Crime Fiction in the Caribbean brings the study of literary writing into scholarly debate on crime in the Caribbean. At the same time, it extends the global turn in crime fiction studies, focusing on a region that has been sidelined even in studies which examine the genre's international dimensions.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,2GQiEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

It offers a theoretically informed field guide, a scholarly cartography of football fiction’s uncertain – and until now – only partially explored terrain. Combining an extensive search for texts with up-to-date academic research, journals, surveys, catalogues, and reviews the book demonstrates a topographic perspective of the field – one that captures and establishes its breadth, depth, and distinctive identity. The book uses and adapts two distinct reading models of abstraction, in conjunction with closer textual analyses. Together they assist in realising a set of demonstrable conventions, outline a taxonomy of fictive types, establish the genre’s current state of play, and advance the football novel as a form with its own literary history and traditions. This book is a valuable resource for those studying and researching in the areas of the social and cultural aspects of football, sports fiction, sports writing, creative writing, and literary and genre studies.

The Cold War, the nuclear age, domestic and international scandals, and an increasingly deceitful political culture catalyzed a filmmaking current that would gradually develop its own narrative form and aesthetics into a new genre. Castrillo Maortua explores the dramatic identity and design of the American political thriller, tracking the close correlation between the evolution of the genre and the history of the United States from the Cuban Missile Crisis to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the ensuing War on Terror. Ultimately, the author demonstrates how the American political thriller defies Hollywood conventions and cultural presuppositions with an entertaining yet critical view of the state of politics.

When the aircraft started deviating from its scheduled route, there was panic at the IGIA air traffic control tower.

The defence minister, external affairs minister and the NSA had accompanied the PM to Islamabad. In their absence, the best men to contact the Indian Air Force Chief were the cabinet secretary or the defence secretary. Both men tried to get hold of him, but to no avail.

In contrast to other volumes which examine morality in crime fiction through the lenses of personal guilt and personal justice, Certainty and Ambiguity in Global Mystery Fiction analyzes the effect of moral imagination on the moral structures implicit in the genre. In recent years, public awareness has attended to the relationship between social structures and justice, and this collection centers on how personal ethics and social ethics are bound together amidst the shifting moral landscapes of mystery fiction. Contributors discuss the interplay between personal guilt and social guilt – considering morality and justice on an individual level and at a societal level – using frameworks of certainty and ambiguity.

By the 1970s, editors were poring over profit-and-loss statements. The electronics company RCA bought Random House in 1965, and then other large corporations purchased other formerly independent publishers. As multinational conglomerates consolidated the industry, the business of literature—and literature itself—transformed. Dan Sinykin explores how changes in the publishing industry have affected fiction, literary form, and what it means to be an author. Giving an inside look at the industry’s daily routines, personal dramas, and institutional crises, he reveals how conglomeration has shaped what kinds of books and writers are published. Sinykin examines four different sectors of the publishing industry: mass-market books by brand-name authors like Danielle Steel; trade publishers that encouraged genre elements in literary fiction; nonprofits such as Graywolf that aspired to protect literature from market pressures; and the distinctive niche of employee-owned W. W. Norton. He emphasizes how women and people of color navigated shifts in publishing, arguing that writers such as Toni Morrison allegorized their experiences in their fiction. Big Fiction features dazzling readings of a vast range of novelists—including E. L. Doctorow, Judith Krantz, Renata Adler, Stephen King, Joan Didion, Cormac McCarthy, Chuck Palahniuk, Patrick O’Brian, and Walter Mosley—as well as vivid portraits of industry figures.

This genre in the South Slavic inter-literary context has not yet been scientifically and systematically studied and presented, although there are critical and scientific reviews that indicate its presence in literary production.

The foreword and coda in this volume, by two internationally-bestselling writers of crime fiction in the north, Yrsa Sigurðardóttir and Gunnar Staalesen, speak to the social contract undertaken by writers of noir, while the interview with the renowned crime writer Val McDermid adds nuance to our understanding of what it is to write noir in the North. Divided into four sections – Gender and Sexuality, Space and Place, Politics and Crime, and Genre and Genealogy – Noir in the North challenges the traditional critical histories of noir by investigating how it functions transnationally beyond the geographical borders of Scandinavia.

The Political Uses of Literature,"Benjamin Kohlmann, Ivana Perica",1501399322,9781501399329,2024,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,213,0.0,0,"Drawing on a global history of politicized writing, this book explores literature's utility as a mode of activism and aesthetic engagement with the political challenges of the current moment. The question of literature's 'uses' has recently become a key topic of academic and public debate. Paradoxically, however, these conversations often tend to bypass the rich history of engagements with literature's distinctly political uses that form such a powerful current of 20th- and 21st-century artistic production and critical-theoretical reflection. The Political Uses of Literature reopens discussion of literature's political and activist genealogies along several interrelated lines: As a foundational moment, it draws attention to the important body of interwar politicized literature and to debates about literature's ability to intervene in social reality. It then traces the mobilization of related conversations and artistic practices across several historical conjunctures, most notably the committed literature of the 1960s and our own present. In mapping out these geographically and artistically diverse traditions – including case studies from the Americas, Europe, Africa, India and Russia – contributors advance critical discussions in the field, making questions pertaining to politicized art newly compelling to a broader and more diverse readership. Most importantly, this volume insists on the need to think about literature's political uses today – at a time when it has become increasingly difficult to imagine any kind of political efficacy for art, even as the need to do so is growing more and more acute. Literature may not proffer easy answers to our political problems, but as this collection suggests, the writing of the 20th century holds out aesthetic resources for a renewed engagement with the dilemmas that face us now.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,f_PiEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The term ‘omission’ as used in the present study, then, demarcates a common artistic phenomenon: a silence, blank, or absence, introduced against the recipient’s generic or experiential expectations, but which nonetheless frequently encapsulates the tenor of the work as a whole. Such omissions can be employed for their affective potential, when emotions represented or evoked by the text are deemed to be beyond words. They can be employed to raise epistemological questions, as when an omission marks the limits of what can be known. Ethical questions can also be approached by means of omissions, as when a character’s voice is omitted, for instance. Finally, omission always carries within it the potential to reflect on the media and genres on which it is brought to bear: as its efficacy depends on the recipient’s generic expectations, omission is frequently characterized by a high degree of meta-discursiveness. This volume investigates the various strategies with which the phenomenon of omission is employed across a range of textual forms and in different cultures to conclusively argue for its status as a highly effective and near-universal form of artistic signification.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,XYWFEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

This book examines the growing body of autobiographical and fictional writing on family and parenting issues in Anglo-American culture from the late 1990s to the present day. The book looks closely at six distinct genres which have arisen during this time frame: the misery memoir, the mum’s lit popular novel, the maternal confessional, ‘dads’ lit, the dysfunctional domestic novel and the family noir. Writing the Modern Family will examine the way these burgeoning areas of British and American writing respond to a neoliberal public discourse in which a ‘parenting deficit’ rather than economic and structural disadvantage, is responsible for increasing inequality in child welfare and achievement. In evaluating these forms and their relationship to neoliberal culture, the book will also consider the complex interrelationship between these genres.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,dfKAEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

A Space of Their Own,"Katie Baker, Naomi Walker",1000859460,9781000859461,2023,Taylor & Francis,152,0.0,0,"This collection explores how nineteenth and twentieth-century women writers incorporated the idea of ‘place’ into their writing. Whether writing from a specific location or focusing upon a particular geographical or imaginary place, women writers working between 1850 and 1950 valued ‘a space of their own’ in which to work. The period on which this collection focuses straddles two main areas of study, nineteenth century writing and early twentieth century/modernist writing, so it enables discussion of how ideas of space progressed alongside changes in styles of writing. It looks to the many ways women writers explored concepts of space and place and how they expressed these through their writings, for example how they interpreted both urban and rural landscapes and how they presented domestic spaces. A Space of Their Own will be of interest to those studying Victorian literature and modernist works as it covers a period of immense change for women’s rights in society. It is also not limited to just one type or definition of ‘space’. Therefore, it may also be of interest to academics outside of literature – for example, in gender studies, cultural geography, place writing and digital humanities.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,ntytEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Horror and Science Fiction Cinema and Society,Martin Harris,1040122299,9781040122297,2024,Taylor & Francis,276,0.0,0,"Examining how horror and science fiction films from the 1950s to the present invent and explore fictional “us-versus-them” scenarios, this book analyzes the different ways such films employ allegory and/or satire to interrogate the causes and consequences of increasing polarization in American politics and society. Starting with the killer ants film with an anti-communist subtext Them! (1954) and concluding with Jordan Peele’s social horror film with revenge-seeking homicidal doppelgängers Us (2019), Martin Harris highlights social and political contexts, contemporary reviews and responses, and retrospective evaluations to show how American horror and science fiction films reflect and respond to contemporary conflicts marking various periods in U.S. history from post-WWII to the present, including those concerning race, gender, class, faith, political ideology, national identity, and other elements of American society. Horror and Science Fiction Cinema and Society draws upon cinematic sociology to provide a resourceful approach to American horror and science fiction films that integrates discussion of plot construction and character development with analyses of the thematic uses of conflict, guiding readers’ understanding of how filmmakers create otherworldly confrontations to deliver real-world social and political commentary.",['Social Science'],['Thriller'],thriller,7jEVEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Rusty is a retired judge attempting a third act in life with a loving soon-to-be wife, Bea, with whom he shares both a restful home on an idyllic lake in the rural Midwest and a plaintive hope that this marriage will be his best, and his last. But the peace that's taken Rusty so long to find evaporates when Bea's young adult son, Aaron, living under their supervision while on probation for drug possession, disappears. If Aaron doesn't return soon, he will be sent back to jail. Aaron eventually turns up with a vague story about a camping trip with his troubled girlfriend, Mae, that ended in a fight and a long hitchhike home. Days later, when she still hasn't returned, suspicion falls on Aaron, and when Mae is subsequently discovered dead, Aaron is arrested and set for trial on charges of first degree murder. Faced with few choices and even fewer hopes, Bea begs Rusty to return to court one last time, to defend her son and to save their last best hope for happiness. For Rusty, the question is not whether to defend Aaron, or whether the boy is in fact innocent – it's whether the system to which he has devoted his life can ever provide true justice for those who are presumed guilty. 5* READER REVIEWS 'Absolutely brilliant' 'Scott Turow at his very best' 'A great legal thriller ...

'Fascinating and persuasive' The Herald 'Everyone involved in the VAR controversy should read this short, beautifully-written book and think again' Sir Michael Barber In 2019, the English Premier League introduced the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), a way of using technology to review and correct the on-field referee's decisions. It's been a disaster: players hate it, managers hate it, pundits line up to pour scorn on its decisions, and fans have coined the chant 'it's not football any more' to describe its effect on the game. Almost every other sport in the world has managed to integrate technology into its decision-making process. Why is football failing so badly? Is it a special case, or have the game's authorities got something wrong? And what does the controversy about VAR tell us about the nature of authority, rationality and technology in the 21st century?",['Sports & Recreation'],['Thriller'],thriller,GW8WEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Hostage,Eli Sharabi,1800756534,9781800756533,2025,Swift Press,177,0.0,0,"On October 7th, 2023, Hamas terrorists stormed Kibbutz Be'eri, shattering the peaceful life Eli Sharabi had built with his British wife, Lianne, and their teenage daughters, Noiya and Yahel. Dragged barefoot out of his front door while his family watched in horror, Sharabi was plunged into the suffocating darkness of Gaza's tunnels. In total he endured a gruelling 491 days in captivity - all the while holding onto the hope that he would one day be reunited with his loved ones. In the first memoir by a released Israeli hostage, and the fastest-selling book in Israel's history, Sharabi offers a searing firsthand account of survival under unimaginable conditions - starvation, isolation, physical beatings, and psychological abuse at the hands of his captors. Eli Sharabi's story is one of hunger and heartache, of physical pain, longing, loneliness and a helplessness that threatens to destroy the soul. But it is also a story of strength, of resilience, and of the human spirit's refusal to surrender. It is about the camaraderie forged in captivity, the quiet power of faith, and one man's unrelenting decision to choose life, time and time again. Reminiscent of Elie Wiesel's Night, Hostage is a profound witness to history, so that it shall be neither forgotten nor erased.",['Biography & Autobiography'],['Thriller'],thriller,bwR2EQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Despite appearances, Emil suspects murder. A few months earlier he would have known just what to do, but now, as East Germany disintegrates, being a Stasi colonel is more of a liability than an asset. More troubling still is that Emil and Lothar were involved in a final clandestine mission, one that has clearly turned deadly.

Meanwhile, CIA agent Claire Saylor, sent to Berlin to assist an Agency mop-up action against their collapsing East German adversaries, has just received an upgrade to her assignment.

The election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 ushered in a new neoliberal era in politics and economics that dramatically reshaped the British landscape. Alongside this political shift, we have seen transformations to the public sphere caused by the arrival of the internet and of social media, and changes in the global balance of power brought about by 9/11, the emergence of China and India as superpowers, and latterly the British vote to leave the European Union. British fiction of the period is intimately interwoven with these historical shifts. This collection brings together some of the most penetrating critics of the contemporary, to explore the role that the British novel has had in shaping the cultural landscape of our time, at a moment, in the wake of the EU referendum of 2016, when the question of what it means to be British has become newly urgent.",['Literary Criticism'],['Thriller'],thriller,YtmdDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Friston, Professor of Neuroscience, University College London ﻿Neuroscientist Nikolay Kukushkin reveals the miracle by which consciousness evolved out of the natural world, from the birth of the cell to the majesty of our modern minds. Science says that you are nothing but a chemical reaction – a collection of atoms and molecules – like rocks, paperclips and everything else in the physical universe. But if that's so, where is the place in this world for your consciousness? In a word, why does it feel so special to be you? Like the Zen Buddhist riddle pondering the imponderable – the sound of a single hand clapping – this book asks the seemingly unanswerable question of how the human mind came to exist within the material world. In search of an answer, neuroscientist Nikolay Kukushkin takes readers on a billion-year journey through time from the roots of our existence to the advent of Homo sapiens, reimagining the story of our evolution. The result is an exhilarating book that embeds our consciousness within a single, unified story of life on Earth. A work of ambitious intellectual scope, One Hand Clapping is distinguished as much by its originality as by the breadth of its imaginative reach – drawing from neuroscience, evolution, philosophy and a rich tapestry of cultural references, all brought to life by the author's own illustrations. Told with the drama and daring of a mythical epic, it reaches deep into our oceanic past to show for the first time how the entire course of Earth's history, from the earliest non-living particles, ultimately led to the formation of our own minds.",['Science'],['Thriller'],thriller,4WtgEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The text surveys a variety of emerging trends and story forms in the field, through both a series of critical essays and personal interviews with scholars, editors, authors, and artists now creating and refining horror stories in the new millennium. The project posits a rationale for the presence of technohorror as a defining concern in contemporary horror literature, marking a departure from the monstrous and spectral traditions of the twentieth century in its depictions of frightful narratives marked by the qualities of plausibility, mundanity, and surprise as we tell stories about what it means to be human. As our culture explores the dichotomies of the born/made, natural/artificial, and human/computer—all while subsumed within a paradigm shift predicated on the transition from the traditions of print to emerging digital communications practices—these changes form the basis for horrific speculations in our texts and technologies.

Marshall Miller would’ve remembered her face even if he hadn’t seen it on a MISSING poster. When a young woman disappears in his small town, the investigation hinges on Marshall’s haunted sighting of her, crying in the back seat of a police car driven by a cop named Maddox.

Now scorned and shamed, he finds unlikely allies as he confronts the ancient secrets behind his small town’s peaceful façade—and learns the truth about his own family.

Nick puts the time to good use and his flirtation with Emilia quickly blooms into romance. Though not long after the affair turns intimate, Nick begins to suspect that Emilia’s interest in him may have sinister, and possibly even ancient, motivations.

Margo has spent most of her life without a family, and with a telekinetic gift she can't quite explain. Since losing her mother less than a year ago, she's felt more alone than ever. When her fiancé Sam takes her to his remote Iowa hometown to meet his family and begin planning their wedding, Margo finally begins to feel like she's home. But the feeling doesn't last long, and Margo soon feels out of place among her future in-laws. Sam's family is different from what she'd expected. Not only is their obsession with a deceased televangelist unsettling, but Margo has begun seeing a strange, mysterious figure from her past—a figure that she thought was put to rest with her mother's passing. As Sam's family begins to take over the wedding plans, Margo tries to regain some control by turning to the town's sole wedding planner, who soon becomes her only confidant, perhaps because she reminds Margo of her former love. But the more Margo tries to distance her past from her future with Sam, the deeper his family pulls her in, forcing upon her generationally archaic traditions that border on ritualistic. As Margo unearths the family's dark web of secrets, she begins to suspect that she may have been brought here for a reason, and it may cost her her life. In the psychologically unsettling vein of I'm Thinking of Ending Things and The Women in the Dark, combined with the socially aware suspense of Get Out, The Ever End takes elevated horror to a new level with a queer, twisted, feminist story that will keep readers guessing until the end, and stay with them long after that.",['Fiction'],"['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Fiction']",horror,swNkEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Only one-year-old Dixie was spared, becoming infamously known as Baby Blue for the song left playing in the aftermath of the slaughter. Twenty-five years later, Dixie is still desperate for a connection to the family she can’t remember. So when her childhood home goes up for sale, Dixie sets aside all reason and moves in. But as the ghosts of her family seemingly begin to take up residence in the house that was once theirs, Dixie starts to question her sanity and wonders if the evil force menacing her is that of her father or a demon of her own making.

Never Boring,Ed Willes,1990776906,9781990776908,2024,Harbour Publishing,218,0.0,0,"Veteran hockey writer Ed Willes takes an irreverent look back at the sometimes thrilling, often infuriating and always fascinating history of the Vancouver Canucks. Cheering for the National Hockey League’s Vancouver Canucks over the last half century has required patience, commitment and a forgiving nature. It’s not that the Canucks have been uniformly awful or drearily predictable. Far from it (as this past season would attest). But every time they seemed close to delivering the ultimate prize to their fan base—the indomitable faithful—they slipped on a banana peel and tumbled straight into the abyss. Most of their failings were self-inflicted. The franchise’s ownership history is as uneven as its won-loss record. But some have been so random and so accidental, the faithful can legitimately wonder what they did to anger the hockey gods. It started in 1970 with a spin of the carnival wheel, which gifted Hall of Fame centre Gilbert Perreault to the Buffalo Sabres and left the Canucks with Dale Tallon. And it’s continued uninterrupted for over 50 years. For decades, veteran Vancouver hockey writer Ed Willes has had his own vantage point on this team that has, in his words, “been haunted by dark and unnatural forces since its inception.” And Willes’s knowledge extends far beyond the most infamous chapters of the story. As this irreverent, often bitterly funny chronicle shows, the litany of woe stretches back farther and runs deeper than many Canucks fans realize, and stars several of the biggest names in hockey history. Willes’s account tells the story of a uniquely confounded franchise and its obsessive followers, who have thus far been denied the thrill of a Stanley Cup championship. Their consolation has been the dubious comfort of wallowing in collective misery.",['Sports & Recreation'],"['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Sports & Recreation']",horror,71wcEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

As gifted as Eden and Gwen are, there is an even stronger entity that stalks them, coveting Gwen's unique talents.

Tragic heroines, windswept moors, dark and stormy nights, castle prisons, and forbidden desires realized at the greatest cost—these are the elements of Gothic horror, given its finest expression in these five enduring novels. Frankenstein: Obsessed with the secret of creation, Swiss scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein cobbles together a body he is determined to bring to life. When the creature opens his eyes one fateful night, the doctor is repulsed: His vision of perfection is a hideous monster. Dr. Frankenstein abandons his creation, but the furious, lonely monster will not be ignored, setting in motion a chain of violence and terror. A gripping story about the ethics of creation and the consequences of trauma, Frankenstein is as relevant today as it is haunting. Dracula: Upon a visit to Transylvania, young English lawyer Jonathan Harker makes a horrifying discovery about Castle Dracula and its resident count, who survives on the blood of human beings. Thus a battle of wits ensues between the vicious count and his various adversaries in this legendary Gothic novel of horror, dark romance, and chilling suspense. Carmilla: Published twenty-five years before Stoker’s Dracula, Carmilla is the passionate, thrilling tale of a mysterious young woman’s dramatic arrival at an isolated castle. The innocent Laura has never seen anyone like the seductive, secretive Carmilla, except in her dreams—and an antique portrait, which resembles the visitor perfectly, down to the mole on her tempting neck. Laura quickly realizes there is something far more dark and sinister about Carmilla than meets the eye. The Great God Pan: When Mr. Clarke agrees to visit his friend Dr. Raymond, he is dubious about the proceedings he is to witness. In pursuit of what Raymond calls “transcendental medicine,” the doctor intends to make a small incision in a woman’s brain, allowing her to see past the world of the senses to a reality beyond imagining—a realm where, Raymond says, one can see the great god Pan. Stephen King has called The Great God Pan “one of the best horror stories ever written.” The Mysteries of Udolpho: Orphaned heroine Emily St. Aubert has been imprisoned by Signor Montoni, her evil guardian, in his gloomy medieval fortress in the Apennines. Terror is the order of the day inside the walls of Udolpho, as Emily struggles against Montoni’s rapacious schemes and the threat of her own psychological disintegration.

When his beloved aunt—the woman who raised him—doesn’t return after her shift as a night nurse and is later found murdered, there is only one place left for Tommie to go: “home” to the mother who handed him over the day he was born. All is not as it seems behind the hedgerow surrounding the lavish Henneberry estate where Tommie’s mother, Esther, works as live-in housekeeper. Her employers have agreed he can stay until she “sorts things out,” but as she's at the family’s beck and call around the clock, Tommie is mostly left on his own to navigate the grounds, the massive house, and the twisted family inside. Soon he is enmeshed in the oppressive attentions of matriarch Muriel, who is often heavily medicated, and of fifteen-year-old Martin, who treats Tommie sometimes like a kid brother, sometimes like a pawn in a confusing game. While Dr. Henneberry mostly ignores Tommie, he also seems eager for him to be gone. Then there’s the elderly neighbour, who may know more about the family's past than anyone else will say.

She has no friends, never gone to school. She has never left this windswept craggy isle off the coast of Ireland. Her mother is cursed: a silent wreck Aoileann calls the “bed-thing.” Alongside her grandmother, Aoileann’s days are an endless monotony of feeding, changing, and caring for the bed-thing. Their island seems cursed, whispering secrets only Aoileann hears. Then Rachel, a vivacious artist from the mainland, arrives with her colicky newborn. Rachel arouses yearnings Aoileann cannot fully comprehend. Soon, the unfolding of her mother’s secret tragedy and Aoileann’s pursuit of her own dark desires are both destined to unleash a maelstrom upon all three of their lives.

Altmann decides whether Dracula can really be blamed for his crimes, since it’s his nature as a vampire to behave a certain way. Arp argues that Dracula’s addiction to live human blood dooms him to perpetual misery. Karavitis sees Dracula as a Randian individual pitted against the Marxist collective. Ketcham contrives a meeting between Dracula and the Jewish theologian Maimonides. Littmann maintains that if we disapprove of Dracula’s behavior, we ought to be vegetarians. Mahon uses the example of Dracula to resolve nagging problems about the desirability of immortality. McCrossin and Wolfe, disinter some of the re-interpretations of this now-mythical character, and asks whether we can identify an essential Dracula. Pramik shows how the Dracula tale embodies Kierkegaard’s three stages of life. Barkman and Versteeg ponder what it would really feel like to be Dracula. The Greens publish some previous unknown letters between Dracula and Camus's Meursault. Vuckovich looks at the sexual morality of characters in the Dracula saga. De Waal explains that ""Dragula"" is scary because every time this being appears, it causes ""gender trouble.""",['Philosophy'],"['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Philosophy']",horror,x6EACgAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

As the daughter of a rancher in 1840s Mexico, Nena knows a thing or two about monsters—her home has long been threatened by tensions with Anglo settlers from the north. But something more sinister lurks near the ranch at night, something that drains men of their blood and leaves them for dead. Something that once attacked Nena nine years ago. Believing Nena dead, Néstor has been on the run from his grief ever since, moving from ranch to ranch working as a vaquero. But no amount of drink can dispel the night terrors of sharp teeth; no woman can erase his childhood sweetheart from his mind. When the United States invades Mexico in 1846, the two are brought abruptly together on the road to war: Nena as a curandera, a healer, striving to prove her worth to her father so that he does not marry her off to a stranger, and Néstor as a member of the auxiliary cavalry of ranchers and vaqueros. But the shock of their reunion—and Nena’s rage at Néstor for seemingly abandoning her long ago—is quickly overshadowed by the appearance of a nightmare made flesh. And unless Nena and Néstor work through their past and face the future together, neither will survive to see the dawn.",['Fiction'],"['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Fiction']",horror,zewFEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Beginning with a discussion of how literary readers ""unlearned"" how to read the fantastic during the heyday of realistic fiction, Gary K. Wolfe goes on to show how the fantastic reasserted itself in popular genre literature, and how these genres themselves grew increasingly unstable in terms of both narrative form and the worlds they portray. More detailed discussions of how specific contemporary writers have promoted this evolution are followed by a final essay examining how the competing discourses have led toward an emerging synthesis of critical approaches and vocabularies.

Catholic Horror and Rhetorical Dialectics,Gavin F.

Hurley analyzes four novels that are foundational to the genre of Catholic horror: J.K. Huysmans's Là-Bas (1891), Robert Hugh Benson's The Light Invisible (1903) and A Mirror of Shalott (1907), and William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist (1971). Putting these texts in conversation with the classical liberal arts, the book shows how Catholic horror fiction coheres in a commitment to dialectical thinking that aims both to resolve-and to accommodate-contrasting world views. Given its use of this methodology, Catholic horror literature is uniquely positioned to draw readers into a contemplative mindset. In presenting ghost stories, tales of possession, and narratives about evil, Catholic horror invites audiences to confront and reflect on profound existential questions-questions about the line between life and death, the nature of being, and the meaning of reality.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,RPgKEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The trope of ""the black man always dies first"" still, however, haunts the genre. This book focuses on the latest cycle of diversity in horror fiction, starting with the release of Get Out in 2017, which inspired a new speculative turn for the genre. Using various critical frameworks like feminism and colonialism, the book also assesses diversity gaps in horror fictions, with an emphasis on marketing and storytelling methodology. Reviewing the canon and definitions of horror may point to influences for future implications of diversity, which has cyclically manifested in horror fictions throughout history. This book studies works from literature, film and television while acknowledging that each of the formats are distinct artforms that complement each other. The author compares diverse representation in novels like The Castle of Otranto, Frankenstein, Fledgling, Broken Monsters and Mexican Gothic. Horror films like Bride of Frankenstein, It Comes at Night, Us and Get Out are also examined. Lastly, the author emphasizes the diverse horror fictions in television, like The Exorcist, Fear the Walking Dead, The Twilight Zone and Castle Rock.",['Performing Arts'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,_xTYEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

I loved this book."" —Grady Hendrix, New York Times bestselling author of How to Sell a Haunted House and The Final Girl Support Group From the acclaimed author of American Comics comes a sweeping and entertaining narrative that details the rise and enduring grip of horror in American literature, and, ultimately, culture—from the taut, terrifying stories of Edgar Allan Poe to the grisly, lingering films of Jordan Peele America is held captive by horror stories. They flicker on the screen of a darkened movie theater and are shared around the campfire. They blare out in tabloid true-crime headlines, and in the worried voices of local news anchors. They are consumed, virally, on the phones in our pockets. Like the victims in any slasher movie worth its salt, we can’t escape the thrall of scary stories. In American Scary, noted cultural historian and Columbia professor Jeremy Dauber takes the reader to the startling origins of horror in the United States. Dauber draws a captivating through line that ties historical influences ranging from the Salem witch trials and enslaved-person narratives directly to the body of work we more closely associate with horror today: the weird tales of H. P. Lovecraft, the lingering fiction of Shirley Jackson, the disquieting films of Alfred Hitchcock, the up-all-night stories of Stephen King, and the gripping critiques of Jordan Peele. With the dexterous weave of insight and style that have made him one of America’s leading historians of popular culture, Dauber makes the haunting case that horror reveals the true depths of the American mind.",['Social Science'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,0GfyEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Author Paul Bail compares John Saul's novels to a cocktail: (mix) one part , one part The Exorcist, a dash of Turn of the Screw, blend well, and serve thoroughly chillingly. Bail traces John Saul's literary career from his 1977 debut novel Suffer the Children—the first paperback original ever to make the New York Times best seller list—to his most recent novel, Black Lightning (1995). It features detailed analyses of eleven of his novels. The study includes never-before-published biographical information, drawing an original interview with John Saul, and a chapter on the history of tales of horror and the supernatural and how these genres have influenced Saul's fiction. Each chapter in this study examines an individual novel. The novels are analyzed for plot structure, characterization, thematic elements, and their relationship to prior and later novels by Saul. In addition, Bail defines and applies a variety of theoretical approaches to the novels—feminist, deconstructionist, Freudian, Jungian, and sociopolitical—to widen the reader's perspective. Bail shows how John Saul enlarged his repertoire from stories of supernatural possession to science-fiction based horror. A complete bibliography of John Saul's fiction and a bibliography of reviews and criticism complete the work. Because of John Saul's great popularity among teenagers and adults, this unique study is a necessary purchase by secondary school and public libraries.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,NOfEEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Since its initial publication in 1978, The Stand has been considered Stephen King’s seminal masterpiece of apocalyptic fiction, with millions of copies sold and adapted twice for television.

Year's Best Hardcore Horror Volume 3,"Luciano Marano, Nathan Robinson, Nathan Ballingrud",193696404X,9781936964048,2018,Red Room Press,316,0.0,0,"Comet Press is extremely proud to present its third annual anthology featuring this year's hardcore corps of authors with the best extreme horror fiction of 2017 that breaks boundaries and trashes taboos. It was a killer year for horror fiction of the harder kind. Authors, editors and publishers presented readers with some startling works of horrific imagination, stories graphic in the extreme yet with subtleties suggesting larger meanings, tales that explore humanity by plumbing depths of soulless inhumanity and, in some cases, outright depravity. The stories here represent the best of them, disturbing tales that dig deep and take you into the dark heart of horror itself, unrelenting and unapologetic. ""So Sings The Siren"" by Annie Neugebauer takes us onto a Dark Fantasy stage for a one-night-only performance of mythological torture. Then Ryan Harding's ""Junk"" gets right to the hardcore stuff with the ultimate dick-pic horror tale. Robert Levy's ""The Cenacle"" is a literary cemetery feast you may have a hard time stomaching (Tums won't save you). Nathan Ballingrud's ""The Maw"" treads surefootedly on Sci-Fi ground, right up to the edge of the Maw itself in a tale of stunning originality. Luciano Marano made his first pro sell when he sold ""Burnt"" to DOA III, certainly one of the year's best anthologies, and the tale has it own fiery fetishistic twist. ""The Better Part of Drowning"" by Octavia Cade treads waters of both science fiction and fantasy but it's pure horror at its biting depths. Tim Waggoner's ""Til Death"" is Lovecraftian Post-Apocalypse horror at its absolute best. ""Letter From Hell"" comes with that special delivery you only get from Matt Shaw. Dani Brown gets down and very dirty in her ""Theatrum Mortuum,"" which may be the most extreme thing you read all year. Glenn Gray's ""Break"" is a hard-to-take anatomy lesson given to a man weary of doing hard time. In ""Bernadette"" Ramiro Perez de Pereda gets medieval in his tale of a djinn summoned by a desperate priest. Brian Hodge takes you on a trip to Mexico you will never forget in ""West of Matamoros, North of Hell."" This story is a masterpiece of suspense, a grueling experience that may well leave you exhausted by the end. You might even feel like a vacation afterward, but we're betting it won't be to Matamoros. Bracken MacLeod's ""Reprising Her Role"" takes us behind the scenes of a porno snuff film for a gut-wrenching reprisal and unexpected bonus footage. A real-life death threat inspired Doug Ford's ""The Watcher"" and we think it shows. ""Scratching From The Outer Darkness"" showcases Tim Curran's descriptive prowess and gives you a tale of hardcore Cthulhu Mythos. Brace yourself when Adam Howe's ""Foreign Bodies"" takes you deep into the bowels of a nasty abyss-which might make a good echo chamber for the laughter Adam's patented black humor is likely to elicit. Sean Patrick Hazlett introduces us to ""Adramelech,"" an ancient demon with a taste for broiled children. Daniel Marc Chant's ""ULTRA"" jacks into a popular VR game called Slut Slayer. But what if it's more than a game? Nathan Robinson takes us into the trees with a group of militant environmentalists who will discover a tree hugger of the deadly sort, entirely alien to their experience. Scott Smith (A Simple Plan and The Ruins) wraps up this year's fat package of the hard stuff in a big bloody bow with ""The Dogs."" The canines in this tale are not Man's Best Friend variety, nor are they Woman's Besties, as you will see. Thanks for coming along into this year's heart of hardcore darkness. We hope to see you on the other side.",['Horror tales'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,3EFHzgEACAAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The Anatomy of Genres,John Truby,0374722811,9780374722814,2022,Picador,328,0.0,0,"A guide to understanding the major genres of the story world by the legendary writing teacher and author of The Anatomy of Story, John Truby. Most people think genres are simply categories on Netflix or Amazon that provide a helpful guide to making entertainment choices. Most people are wrong. Genre stories aren’t just a small subset of the films, video games, TV shows, and books that people consume. They are the all-stars of the entertainment world, comprising the vast majority of popular stories worldwide. That’s why businesses—movie studios, production companies, video game studios, and publishing houses—buy and sell them. Writers who want to succeed professionally must write the stories these businesses want to buy. Simply put, the storytelling game is won by mastering the structure of genres. The Anatomy of Genres: How Story Forms Explain the Way the World Works is the legendary writing teacher John Truby’s step-by-step guide to understanding and using the basic building blocks of the story world. He details the three ironclad rules of successful genre writing, and analyzes more than a dozen major genres and the essential plot events, or “beats,” that define each of them. As he shows, the ability to combine these beats in the right way is what separates stories that sell from those that don’t. Truby also reveals how a single story can combine elements of different genres, and how the best writers use this technique to craft unforgettable stories that stand out from the crowd. Just as Truby’s first book, The Anatomy of Story, changed the way writers develop stories, The Anatomy of Genres will enhance their quality and expand the impact they have on the world.",['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,NnlUEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

In the spring of 1959, The Diary of Anne Frank has just come to the silver screen to great acclaim, and a young woman named Margie Franklin is working in Philadelphia as a secretary at a Jewish law firm. On the surface she lives a quiet life, but Margie has a secret: a life she once lived, a past and a religion she has denied, and a family and a country she left behind. Margie Franklin is really Margot Frank, older sister of Anne, who did not die in Bergen-Belsen as reported, but who instead escaped the Nazis for America. But now, as her sister becomes a global icon, Margie’s carefully constructed American life begins to fall apart. A new relationship threatens to overtake the young love that sustained her during the war, and her past and present begin to collide.

Horror Niche Growth,"Ethan Parker, AI",8233977624,9788233977627,2025,Publifye AS,157,0.0,0,"Horror Niche Growth explores the evolution of horror from a niche interest to a mainstream phenomenon, examining its historical development, socio-cultural influences, and integration into popular culture. The book argues that horror's growing acceptance reflects its adaptability and ability to engage with contemporary issues. Intriguingly, horror provides a space to confront societal anxieties, and its increased mainstream presence involves adaptations and critical acclaim for previously marginalized creators.

Kennedy, and a soul-sucking ancient mummy. This same novella won a Bram Stoker Award, one of the ten Bram Stoker Awards given to Lansdale thus far in his illustrious career.

The consistently high level of quality in his work has resulted in every major award that weird fiction has to offer, including the Grand Master Award of the World Horror Convention, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Horror Writers Association, and the Living Legend Award of the International Horror Guild. Strangely, though, relatively little criticism has been written about Campbell. In Ramsey Campbell: Critical Essays on the Modern Master of Horror, Gary William Crawford has assembled a collection of articles that examine the work of one of weird fiction’s most revered writers. These essays looks at a number of elements that characterize Campbell’s stories and novels, including comparisons to H.P. Lovecraft, who was an early inspiration; Campbell’s modern variations of Gothic fiction; his concept of evil; religious subtext in his fiction; and how adversities Campbell has faced have shaped his life and his work. In all, these essays pay homage to Campbell’s painstaking craftsmanship and show that there is much to be mined in his fiction. Because Campbell is so important in the genre of horror literature, this book serves as a much needed affirmation of his work. It will be of interest to scholars of supernatural fiction in general, but also to devoted fans of this major figure in weird fiction.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,e5FWAgAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Jennings discusses the necessity for black heroes, not just for the sake of diversity, but for inclusiveness, touching on the conventions he has cofounded, such as the Schomburg Center’s Black Comic Book Festival in Harlem. He addresses the struggle to be financially compensated for work, and he speaks at length about how being a professor informs his craft where he continues to examine black stereotypes in popular culture with courses of his own design. As a group the interviews in John Jennings: Conversations give a picture of a black man forging a way where comic books have afforded him a means to carve out an important space for people of color.",['Biography & Autobiography'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,L17wDwAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Fights of Fancy,"George Edgar Slusser, Eric S. Rabkin",0820315338,9780820315331,1993,University of Georgia Press,236,0.0,0,"This collection of fifteen original essays offers new perspectives on armed conflict as a central aspect of science fiction and fantasy writing. Looking past the superficial conventions associated with ray guns and aliens, swords and sorcerers, the contributors show how writers in the genre today are not so much imagining war more fully as they are completely re-imagining it. Science fiction and fantasy writing is no longer mired in epic or chivalric models but is responding to new and more complex ""real-world"" motivations for armed aggression: advances in weaponry, shifts in the theaters of war, and changes in battlefield conditions. Most of the papers were presented at the annual J. Lloyd Eaton Conference on Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, the field's most prestigious international gathering. The trend throughout the book is away from critical interest in stories of spatial or territorial conquest and toward works that deal with topics related to wars of temporal logistics and the internationalization of the combat zone, including urban street violence, gender conflicts, and resistance to runaway technology. The essays range from studies of the semantics and linguistics of warfare in science fiction to a critique of Osip Senkovsky's Fantastic Journeys of Baron Brambeus; from writer Joe Haldeman's assessment of the impact of his Vietnam experiences on his fiction to inquiries into a shared author/reader agenda in novels concerning potential mass destruction, including Stephen King's Dead Zone and M. J. Engh's Arslan. The collection also charts new directions in writing, such as the anti-apocalyptic science fiction of Samuel R. Delany, and embraces new modes of presentation, particularly computer animation and the bande dessinee, or illustrated narrative, as exemplified by French novelist Phillippe Druillet's La Nuit. Musician Bob Marley, film actor/directors Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Lee, and the cyberpunk film classics Terminator and the Road Warrior series are among other topics discussed. Together, the essays reinforce the editors' contention that the true function of these fantasies and science fictions is neither nostalgia nor fancy, but analysis. The contributors treat the texts they examine as a means not of playing war games but of understanding the role of war in the present and the future.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,v82iKN6E6NMC,,0,,[],0.0

Focusing on a variety of literary and non-literary texts, the book maps out the dialogue between the Victorian life and social sciences most involved in the study of language and the literary genre frequently indicted for causing linguistic corruption and debasement - popular fiction. Ferguson demonstrates how Darwinian biological, philological, and anthropological accounts of 'primitive' and animal language were co-opted into wider cultural debates about the apparent brutality of popular fiction, and shows how popular novelists such as Marie Corelli, Grant Allen, H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard, and Bram Stoker used their fantastic narratives to radically reformulate the relationships among language, thought, and progress that underwrote much of the contemporary prejudice against mass literary taste. In its alignment of scientific, cultural, and popular discourses of human language, Language, Science, and Popular Fiction in the Victorian Fin-de-Siècle stands as a corrective to assessments of best-selling fiction's intellectual, ideological, and aesthetic simplicity.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,P2ZBDgAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

How did the experience of the Vietnam War change the United States, not just in the 1950s through the 1970s, but through to today? What role do popular music and movies play in how we think of the Vietnam War? How similar are the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—and now Syria—to the Vietnam War in terms of duration, cost, success and failure rates, and veteran issues? This two-volume set addresses these questions and many more, examining how the Vietnam War has been represented in media, music, and film, and how American popular culture changed because of the war. Accessibly written and appropriate for students and general readers, this work documents how the war that occurred on the other side of the globe in the jungles of Vietnam impacted everyday life in the United States and influenced various entertainment modes. It not only covers the impact of the counterculture revolution, popular music about Vietnam recorded while the war was being fought (and after), and films made immediately following the end of the war in the 1970s, but also draws connections to more modern events and popular culture expressions, such as films made in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Attention is paid to the impact of social movements like the environmental movement and the civil rights movement and their relationships to the Vietnam War.

Border Politics in Novels by European Women in Translation,Pam Morris,135043406X,9781350434066,2024,Bloomsbury Publishing,225,0.0,0,"Is conflict inherent to the politics of borders? Recent global events, erupting from national, religious, class, racial and gender boundaries would suggest it is. From the inhumanity of post-Brexit British immigration policy to the violent suppression of women's freedom in Iran, to Russia's territorial invasion of Ukraine, and most immediately to the violent conflagration engulfing Palestine, border hostilities seem everywhere characterised by fearful and toxic intolerance of what is deemed other. This book examines the writing of award-winning European novelists to suggest an alternative perspective, one that redresses time-sanctioned hierarchies of mind over body, of ideals over physical reality. It explores novelistic representations of power, war, sacrifice, heroism, national history and identity, all issues more conventionally viewed within a male consensus. The fiction offers a cultural and imaginative response to border conflicts of all kinds, ethical, bodily, religious, and geographical, often drawing upon the writers' own personal experience of threatening divisions. Examining works by Virginia Woolf, Jenny Erpenbeck, Olga Tokarczuk, Herta Müller, Anna Burns, Chika Unigwe, Maylis de Kerangal, Magda Szabó, Elena Ferranti, Alki Zei, Elif Shafak, and Oksana Zabuzhko, it uses an integrated interdisciplinary approach to combine literary readings with detailed historical and political understanding of cultural context. Coming from many different cultures and histories, these writers speak a common condemnation of all hierarchies of worth and of exceptionalist identities whether sanctified by religion, nature, or tradition. Morris shows how their stories, read here in translation, also articulate a strikingly unified vision of a radical ecological understanding of human relations based on physical continuity and co-existence rather than borders dividing an idealised 'us' from a denigrated 'them'.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,LPQREQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Robin Hoffman, Kirsten Kowalewski, Peter C. Kunze, Jorie Lagerwey, Nick Levey, Jessica R. McCort, and Janani Subramanian Dark novels, shows, and films targeted toward children and young adults are proliferating wildly. It is even more crucial now to understand the methods by which such texts have traditionally operated and how those methods have been challenged, abandoned, and appropriated. Reading in the Dark fills a gap in criticism devoted to children's popular culture by concentrating on horror, an often-neglected genre. These scholars explore the intersection between horror, popular culture, and children's cultural productions, including picture books, fairy tales, young adult literature, television, and monster movies. Reading in the Dark looks at horror texts for children with deserved respect, weighing the multitude of benefits they can provide for young readers and viewers. Refusing to write off the horror genre as campy, trite, or deforming, these essays instead recognize many of the texts and films categorized as ""scary"" as among those most widely consumed by children and young adults. In addition, scholars consider how adult horror has been domesticated by children's literature and culture, with authors and screenwriters turning that which was once horrifying into safe, funny, and delightful books and films. Scholars likewise examine the impetus behind such re-envisioning of the adult horror novel or film as something appropriate for the young.

How can writing be more than narcissism and self-aggrandizement? These questions were ones that the writer and naturalist Barry Lopez asked at the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference in the summer of 2000, and they are questions at the heart of About That Life, a meditation on matters of living, making, and seeking. While Lopez is best known for such works of nonfiction as the National Book Award-winning Arctic Dreams, Matthew Cheney brings our attention to the many works of short fiction that Lopez published throughout his life, demonstrating how they fit within Lopez’s sense of ethical aesthetics. That sense is then set alongside the work of San Francisco’s New Narrative writers, insights from David Hinton’s translations of Tu Fu, the story of community arising around a pottery kiln in western Oregon, the beauties and contradictions of Sōetsu Yanagi’s The Unknown Craftsman, and the implications of the right-wing mob attack on the U.S. Capitol – an event that occurred on what would have been Barry Lopez’s 76th birthday.

In Useful Captives volume editors Daniel Krebs and Lorien Foote and their contributors explore the wide range of roles that captives play in times of conflict: hostages used to negotiate vital points of contention between combatants, consumers, laborers, propaganda tools, objects of indoctrination, proof of military success, symbols, political instruments, exemplars of manhood ideals, loyal and disloyal soldiers, and agents of change in society. The book’s eleven chapters cover conflicts involving Americans, ranging from colonial warfare on the Creek-Georgia border in the late eighteenth century, the American Revolution, the Civil War, the Great War, World War II, to twenty-first century U.S. drone warfare. This long historical horizon enables the reader to go beyond the prison camp experience of POWs to better understand the many ways they influence the nature and course of military conflict. Useful Captives shows the vital role that prisoners of war play in American warfare and reveals the cultural contexts of warfare, the shaping and altering of military policies, the process of state-building, the impacts upon the economy and environment of the conflict zone, their special place in propaganda and political symbolism, and the importance of public history in shaping national memory.",['History'],"['Splatter-punk', 'Horror']",splatterpunk,IPinEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Not only does Violence in American Popular Culture provide a comprehensive review of the research about the effects of violence in media, but it also offers detailed assessments of violent content in various expressions of popular culture.

Amazons in the Digital Era,Arturo Sánchez Sanz,1350462187,9781350462182,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing,281,0.0,0,"For more than 3,000 years, the Amazons have been a recognised symbol that transcends mythology and has influenced history itself. The image of the powerful warrior woman who defied the established patriarchal order proved so compelling that it became permanently enshrined in the collective imagination-first through oral tradition and later through texts and images. The contributions in this volume explore how this image has endured through the lens of classical reception. From Wonder Woman to the war in Ukraine, and across diverse genres such as video games, fashion, warfare and documentary film, the Amazonian archetype has evolved beyond anything once imagined. Today, however, we are witnessing a true transformation. No longer embodying the negative traits the Greeks once ascribed to them, the Amazons have become a symbol of strength, resilience and empowerment-a model for women's rights in a global society and an icon of feminism and the LGBTQIA+ community. Divided into three parts, this book analyses how the image of the Amazon has, at different times and in different contexts, been marginalised, put on a pedestal and globalised. For the first time, media case studies and lived histories are examined to compare and contrast modern frameworks with each other and with the 'original' Amazonian iconography. What emerges is a concept of the 'Amazon' as a modern paradigm that speaks as strongly to contemporary society as it did to the ancients, but with a very different meaning.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,rZhmEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Broken down into thematic sections, the book traces the literary output of pioneering psychoanalysts such as Julia Kristeva, Bruce Fink, Thomas Odgen, and Gregorio Kohon, among others. Berman looks at works of historical fiction, detective fiction, and the short story, and shows how recurring themes typical of these genres can be understood both psychoanalytically and through a literary lens. The works included investigate experiences of childhood adversity, life in dystopian societies, experiences of psychosis, bodily autonomy, personal loss and, above all, trauma. Unpacking these themes, and their depiction through fiction, Berman gives the reader the tools to apply psychoanalytic literary theory to further works. Interweaving his personal correspondence with authors, including a heartwarming exchange with Cliff Wilkerson, Berman offers unparalleled access to the inner workings of the writers’ minds. This book will be of interest to students and researchers using psychoanalytic literary theory, as well as mental health practitioners who are interested in the intersections between literature and psychoanalysis and discovering new ways of probing the unspoken and unconscious.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,BpdjEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

This is the definitive two-volume companion to this important work. SECONDARY is a five-channel video installation, performed in Barney’s Long Island City studio in 2023, then in London, Paris, and Los Angeles in 2024. The plot revolves around an accident that occurred during a football game in 1978, when Oakland Raiders’ Jack Tatum delivered an open field hit on Darryl Stingley, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots. Stingley was left paralyzed. The tragic event remained seared in the minds of American fans, including Barney himself, a youth-league quarterback at the time. Through allusion to American sports culture, SECONDARY explores the complex intersection of violence, its representation, and its celebration. It reimagines the game through a unique movement vocabulary. The result is a physical study that focuses on every element of the game, from drills and pre-game rituals to moments of impact and their slow-motion replays. Volume 1 explores SECONDARY in depth, with essays by leading contemporary voices. Volume 2 maps the life of Barney’s former Long Island City studio, where SECONDARY premiered to the public.

Of course, neither feminist nor intersectional approaches are new in and of themselves: for decades, literary scholarship has studied the impact of particular constellations of gender, race, and class when it comes to representations of women in literary texts and has succeeded in shaking monolithic and stereotypical notions of womanhood. However, research at the intersection of law, literature and feminism has so far been limited and insular. Bringing together more than twenty international researchers from related disciplines, this volume is the first to bring questions of intersectional feminism to the forefront of law and literature scholarship. From reproductive and (trans-)gender justice in law and literature to feminist practices that intervene in judicial discourse, this volume brings into focus a wide range of cultural and legal phenomena in which gender and the law intersect in literary texts. The volume’s commitment to intersectionality fittingly extents to its very make up: the contributors were selected to represent a diverse range of positions in terms of their gender, career stage and nationality.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,WHlVEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

For as long as anyone can remember, Zeke Ladoja and Imogen Parker have been best friends. Their classmates, their parents, and even the school custodian think that they’re meant to be together. And that’s exactly what Zeke wants: for Gen to be his girlfriend. Now that she’s about to be sixteen (and allowed to date), Zeke is finally going to tell her how he feels—in front of everyone at her birthday party. Imogen loves Zeke with all her heart, but only as a friend. The pressure to be with Zeke has sometimes been overwhelming, but up to this point, she’s been able to manage it. Then she falls for the new boy, Trevor Cook, and she knows the news will devastate Zeke. The last thing she wants to do is hurt her best friend, but she also resents the fact that no one seems to care about what she wants. The night of Gen’s party, everything goes wrong. There’s backlash, most of it directed at Gen, and Zeke feels emboldened. He isn’t about to give up on his feelings, and he’ll do whatever it takes to prove that she made the wrong choice…even if it means destroying their friendship.

Fictional stories have long held an uncanny power over hearts and minds, especially those of young people. In Dangerous Fictions, Lyta Gold traces arguments both historical and contemporary that have labeled fiction as dark, immoral, frightening, or poisonous. Within each she asks: How “dangerous” is fiction, really? And what about it provokes waves of moral panic and even censorship? Gold argues that any panic about art is largely a disguised panic about power. There have been versions of these same fights over fiction for centuries. By exposing fiction as a social danger and a battleground of immediate public concern, we can see what each side really wants—the right to shape the future of a world deeply in flux and a distraction from more pressing material concerns about money, access, and the hard work of politics. From novels about people driven insane by reading novels to “copaganda” TV shows that influence how viewers regard the police, Gold uses her signature wit, research, and fearless commentary to point readers toward a more substantial question: Fiction may be dangerous to us, but aren’t we also dangerous to it?",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,XKdOEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

In contemporary literature, there is a growing number of authors with migration experience, some of whom write not in native tongue, but in their second or third language and who represent their experience of migration as encounter of different historical memories. When migrating to a new place, people enter not only a new political and cultural structure, but also a new framework of memory. They need to adjust their historical imaginaries, thereby also contesting and expanding the framework they enter. The volume explores how contemporary literature addresses specific historical legacies, juxtaposes them multidirectionally and disseminates them in original and through translation in different parts of the world and in various social contexts. Furthermore, this volume traces literature’s role in the processes of memory circulation, translation and reception from the interdisciplinary perspectives of cultural memory studies, translation studies, reception studies and the studies of migrant and multilingual literature.",['Social Science'],"['New Release', 'Social Science']",new_releases,qSxiEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Seventeen-year-old Leopold Berry is seeing weird things around Los Angeles. A man who pops a tooth into a parking meter. A glowing trapdoor in a parking lot. A half-mechanical raccoon with its tail on fire that just won’t leave him alone. Every hallucinatory moment seems plucked from a cheesy 1990s fantasy TV show called Max's Adventures in Sunderworld—and that’s because they are. Not a good sign. In the blurry weeks after his mother’s death, a young Leopold discovered VHS tapes of its one and only season in a box headed for the trash—and soon became obsessed. Losing himself in Sunder was the best way to avoid two things: grieving his mother and being a chronic disappointment to his overbearing father. But when the strange visions return—at the worst possible time on the worst possible day—Leopold turns to his best friend Emmet for help. Together they discover that Sunder is much more than just an old TV show, and that Los Angeles is far stranger than they ever imagined. And soon, he’ll realize that not only is Sunderworld real, but it’s in grave danger. Certain he’s finally been chosen for greatness, Leopold risks everything to claim his destiny, save the world of his childhood dreams, and prove once and for all that he’s not the disappointment his father believes him to be. But when everything goes terribly, horribly, excruciatingly wrong, Leopold’s disappointments prove to be more extraordinary than he ever could have imagined.

When Alex sees an advertisement searching for her replacement, she impulsively applies, never expecting to actually get the job. Against all odds, Alex is given the position and quickly proves herself skilled at solving other people's problems. But soon, she begins to receive strange, potentially threatening letters at the office. Francis's murderer was never identified, turning everyone around her into a threat. Including her boss, editor-in-chief Howard Dimitri, who has a habit of staying late at the office and drinking too much. As Alex is drawn into the details surrounding her predecessor's murder, her own dark secrets begin to rise to the surface and Alex suddenly finds herself trapped in a dangerous and potentially deadly game of cat and mouse that takes her all the way from the power centers of Manhattan to Francis Keen's summer house, where her body was found and where the killer may just be waiting for her""--",['Fiction'],"['New Release', 'Fiction']",new_releases,WYpUEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Featuring a steamy enemies-to-lovers romance and a fight for the witching world that will get your heart racing. Merry doesn’t need a happily-ever-after. Her life in the charming, idyllic town of Candlecott is fine just as it is. Simple, happy, and with absolutely no magic. Magic only ever leads to trouble. But Merry’s best friend, Teddy, is joining the Toadmen—a secret society who specialize in backward thinking and suspiciously supernatural traditions—and Merry is determined to stop him. Even if it means teaming up with the person she hates most: her academic archnemesis, Caraway Boswell, an ice-cold snob who hides his true face under a glamour. An ancient Toad ritual is being held in the sinister Deeping Fen, and if Merry doesn’t rescue Teddy before it’s finished, she’ll lose him forever. But the Toadmen have been keeping dangerous secrets, and so has Caraway. The farther Merry travels into Deeping Fen’s foul waters, the more she wonders if she’s truly come to save her friend . . . or if she’s walking straight into a trap.

Reading Postcolonial Literature,Hayley G. Toth,1836243278,9781836243274,2025,Liverpool University Press,121,0.0,0,"An Open Access edition is available thanks to the kind sponsorship of the libraries participating in the Jisc Open Access Community Framework OpenUP initiative. Debates about reading in postcolonial studies rarely discuss non-professional readers, except to secure the authority of professional reading practices. In Reading Postcolonial Literature, Hayley G. Toth places non-professional reading practices in dialogue with received academic wisdom to debunk common-sense assumptions about non-professional readers as ‘Western’ or ‘neocolonial’ consumers. Drawing on reading practices recorded in academic books, journal articles and on online book-reviewing platforms like Amazon and Goodreads, Toth draws attention to important continuities between professional and non-professional practices of reading postcolonial literature. At the same time, she highlights that non-professionals often have little desire to emulate the practices of professional postcolonial critics. Precisely by not adopting the established protocols and methods of postcolonial studies, non-professional readers call attention to the limits of dominant approaches to reading in the discipline. Across four chapters, Toth examines the relationship between reading and identity during the Rushdie affair, the difference between reading and address, the challenges posed by difficult texts and the legitimacy of non-understanding, and the reception of popular texts primarily read by non-professional audiences. Reading Postcolonial Literature demonstrates that reception matters in any claims we make about the value of reading postcolonial literature, and offers new ways forward for the practice, study and teaching of reading in the discipline.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,SLdNEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0
Francophone Literature After the Postcolonial Age,Farid Laroussi,1978781806,9781978781801,2024,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,167,0.0,0,"Francophone Literature After the Postcolonial Age argues that Francophone literature extends beyond the postcolonial critical landmarks that helped define the field since the late 1980s. Today Francophone literature maps out different paths that highlight its emancipation from both the Francophonie's cultural ascendency and postcolonial theory's scholarly hegemony. Farid Laroussi's argument is that three main forces have reshaped the French postcolonial in the twenty-first century: digital globalization, intertextuality, and ecocriticism. With digital globalization, Francophone literature finds new voices, unfettered from former aesthetic, print and distribution diktats. Home and the exilic paradigm are redefined in the postcolonial subject's own terms. Intertextuality reconnects with poetic dialogism, sans the mimicry burden. The intertextuality challenge showcases a new writers' community, across time and cultures. The old anxiety around one's own poetic voice now provides valid responses to literary reconfigurations. The book's study cases operate around three specific pairings: Segalen/Glissant, Kafka/Maghreb literature, and Morrison/Miano. Lastly, ecocriticism, along the decolonial discourse, comes to discuss the place of the postcolonial home as well as the responsibility category. The author contends that the attention to the land cannot be separated from imaginaries, collective and individual. Francophone writers stand at the crossroads of activism and poetics moving further away from French metropolitan preoccupations.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,yYl2EQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The Ecogothic Werewolf in Literature,Kaja Franck,1350441139,9781350441132,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing,217,0.0,0,"Using an Ecogothic lens, this book offers a new conceptual framework for the werewolf in literature, recasting the lycanthrope as an emblem for society's fear of untamed wilderness. Tracing lycanthropy from a place of liminality to hybridity and to myriad and complex subjectivities, The Ecogothic Werewolf in Literature reassesses the Gothic werewolf to show how the relationship between humans and wolves has influenced its representation in literature. Starting with Dracula and tracing lycanthropic imaginings through natural histories, folk and fairy tales to contemporary iterations in the works of Maggie Stiefvater, Whitley Strieber and Glen Duncan, Kaja Franck reconsiders the trope of the 'beast within' in the werewolf canon. From early conservationist Aldo Leopold's awakening regarding the death of wolves, to George Monbiot's call to rewild, tensions around humanity's responsibility to the natural world have emerged in lycanthropic literature. A challenge to previous anthropocentric analysis of Gothic horror's stock monster, Franck considers the changing attitude towards wolves alongside the growing environmentalism movement and reclaims the wolf from the figure of the werewolf.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,gvdmEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Torn between wanting to participate in art shows and not wanting to get exposed to COVID, I was haunted by the feeling that life was passing me by. I felt like I was living my life in captivity, missing all its forgone pleasures. This wasn’t the future I wanted. This wasn’t the world I wanted to live in. I wasn’t the woman I wanted to be. Being an artist was a leap of faith and I was getting tired of jumping. In a world of artifice and denial, what still mattered? The pursuit of normal at any cost had led to a culture of complacency and resignation, warnings unheeded, lessons unlearned. The aftermath of an ongoing crisis that most of the world deliberately ignored was a time of missed opportunities and impossible choices. Just when I needed them the most for publicity, the internet platforms I had come to rely on made it harder for my work to be seen, as tech disruption left upheaval and destruction in its wake. Would my newfound social media sites and online communities help me connect with a new audience, or would my participation in them only further tech oligarchs’ nefarious goals? Though making art is my escape, this book is also about what I was trying to escape from. Finding solace in creating art in a world on the precipice of disaster, I have made this book an archive of three years of art, grief and grievances.",['Art'],"['New Release', 'Art']",new_releases,v0J-EQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Using an in-depth Australian case study, this book narrates this profound period of proliferation. It also considers how incumbent commercial networks, pay-TV providers and public service broadcasters developed into online TV providers, albeit in assorted ways. In so doing, it conceives of the early impact of online TV (2015–2020) more broadly and acknowledges the role of both new and old TV players. The industry-wide shift towards online TV over this period also impacted existing television drama production cultures. SVOD services provided a fruitful avenue for the distribution of existing archives and slowly began to support the production of new Australian content with an increasingly global focus. However, the formal arrival of online TV certainly did not usher in the boom in original local television drama many anticipated.

Yet, the grassroots projects of devotees in niche punk, noise and hip-hop DIY music scenes have continuously upheld the unique material benefits of cassettes while wider society considered them a relic of bygone times. Contrasting the popular notion of current cassette use being a mere side effect of the blazing interest in the vinyl record, this book argues that the lasting embrace of tapes is based on complex cultural, economic and material factors that shape cassettes as hybrid artefacts of music in the new media age. Drawing on interviews with 85 experts active in DIY music cultures as independent record shop operators, musicians, event promoters, fans and collectors across Japan, Australia and the United States, Tomorrow on Cassette presents a seminal exploration of how the cassette tape's significance as a tool for material expression, creativity and sociality perseveres in the 21st-century.",['Music'],"['New Release', 'Music']",new_releases,zKNUEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Classical Civilisation and Ancient History in British Secondary Education,"Edith Hall, Arlene Holmes-Henderson",1800855648,9781800855649,2025,Liverpool University Press,264,0.0,0,"An Open Access edition will be available on publication on the Liverpool University Press website, thanks to funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). In the UK A-Levels and GCSEs in Classical Civilisation and Ancient History offer exciting avenues through which to access the cultures of people who spoke ancient Greek and Latin, and their neighbours, across the ancient Mediterranean and Black Sea worlds. They are inherently interdisciplinary, offering an outstanding opportunity to study a civilisation in the round, using diverse sources from literary and philosophical texts to legal documents, inscriptions, art, architecture and archaeology. Yet many people are either unaware of the existence of these courses, or do not understand their contents. This unprecedented study, by two Classics Professors at the University of Durham with extensive experience of teaching in schools and HEIs, charts the subjects’ historical development and emergence in their current form since the mid-20th century, explaining and illustrating their contents. It describes the skills and competencies that they confer, which are valued by university admissions offices and employers alike. It presents the results of interviews with several significant participants in the story of these classical subjects and of questionnaires filled in by many additional teachers and students. It also offers practical advice on how to introduce Classical Civilisation and/or Ancient History at secondary level, with guides to bibliographical and other resources.",['Education'],"['New Release', 'Education']",new_releases,cStsEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Or that it was essential to the development of science and religion? Acclaimed journalist Rebecca Boyle takes readers on a dazzling tour to reveal the intimate role that our 4.51-billion-year-old companion has played in our biological and cultural evolution. Our Moon’s gravity stabilized Earth’s orbit—and its climate. It drew nutrients to the surface of the primordial ocean, where they fostered the evolution of complex life. The Moon continues to influence animal migration and reproduction, plants’ movements, and, possibly, the flow of the very blood in our veins. While the Sun helped prehistoric hunters and gatherers mark daily time, early civilizations used the phases of the Moon to count months and years, allowing them to plan farther ahead. Mesopotamian priests recorded the Moon’s position in order to make predictions, and, in the process, created the earliest known empirical, scientific observations. In Our Moon, Boyle introduces us to ancient astronomers and major figures of the scientific revolution, including Johannes Kepler and his influential lunar science fiction. Our relationship to the Moon changed when Apollo astronauts landed on it in 1969, and it’s about to change again. As governments and billionaires aim to turn a profit from its resources, Rebecca Boyle shows us that the Moon belongs to everybody, and nobody at all.",['Science'],"['New Release', 'Science']",new_releases,XSlIEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The promise of starting life anew somewhere far, far away—no climate change, no war, no doomscrolling—beckons, and settling the stars ﬁnally seems within our grasp. Or is it? Critically acclaimed, bestselling authors Kelly and Zach Weinersmith set out to write the essential guide to a glorious future of space settlements, but after years of research, they aren’t so sure it’s a good idea. Space technologies and space businesses are progressing fast, but we lack the knowledge needed to have space kids, build space farms, and create space nations in a way that doesn’t spark conflict back home. In a world hurtling toward human expansion into space, A City on Mars investigates whether the dream of new worlds won’t create nightmares, both for settlers and the people they leave behind. In the process, the Weinersmiths answer every question about space you’ve ever wondered about, and many you’ve never considered: Can you make babies in space? Should corporations govern space settlements? What about space war? Are we headed for a housing crisis on the Moon’s Peaks of Eternal Light—and what happens if you’re left in the Craters of Eternal Darkness? Why do astronauts love taco sauce? Speaking of meals, what’s the legal status of space cannibalism?

This is cultural criticism at its finest. I’ll read anything Kidd writes.” — Tajja Isen, author of Some of My Best Friends In 1999, after three years of secular living in Eastern Europe, Joelle Kidd moved back to Canada and was enrolled in the strange world of an evangelical Christian school. Immediately, she found herself in a strange world of upbeat Christan pop music, purity education, and desperately trendy Bible redesigns, trying to make sense of this unfamiliar preteen cultural landscape. In Jesusland, Joelle writes about the Christian pop culture that she was suddenly immersed in, from perky girl bands to modest styling tips, and draws connections between this evangelical subculture and the mainstream, a tense yet reciprocal relationship that both disavows the secular while employing its media markers. But none of this was just about catchy songs; every abstinence quiz in a teen magazine was laying the foundation for what would become a conservative Christian movement that threatens women’s healthcare, attacks queer and trans rights, and drives present-day political division. Through nine incisive, honest, and emotional essays, Jesusland exposes the pop cultural machinations of evangelicalism, while giving voice to aughts-era Christian children and teens who are now adults looking back at their time measuring the length of their skirts, and asking each other if their celebrity crush was Christian enough. With care and generosity, Jesusland shows us how the conservative evangelical movement became the global power it is today by exploring the pop culture that both reflected and shaped an entire generation of young people.",['Social Science'],"['New Release', 'Social Science']",new_releases,1K9PEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Watson So wrote Dr. Watson in ""The Problem of Thor Bridge"" - and ever since, Sherlockians have been bringing us new adventures from this legendary tin dispatch box.

Now, ten years later, the series draws to a close, having grown to 52 massive volumes and over 1,000 stories.

A Fate Inked in Blood,Danielle L.

Bound in an unwanted marriage, Freya spends her days gutting fish, but dreams of becoming a warrior. And of putting an axe in her boorish husband’s back. Freya’s dreams abruptly become reality when her husband betrays her to the region’s jarl, landing her in a fight to the death against his son, Bjorn. To survive, Freya is forced to reveal her deepest secret: She possesses a drop of a goddess’s blood, which makes her a shield maiden with magic capable of repelling any attack. It was foretold such a magic would unite the fractured nation of Skaland beneath the one who controls the shield maiden’s fate. Believing he’s destined to rule Skaland as king, the fanatical jarl binds Freya with a blood oath and orders Bjorn to protect her from their enemies. Desperate to prove her strength, Freya must train to fight and learn to control her magic, all while facing perilous tests set by the gods. The greatest test of all, however, may be resisting her forbidden attraction to Bjorn. If Freya succumbs to her lust for the charming and fierce warrior, she risks not only her own destiny but the fate of all the people she swore to protect.",['Fiction'],"['New Release', 'Fiction']",new_releases,hzwyEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

A Dream Come True,Stephan Eicke,,9798765129074,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,289,0.0,0,"A Dream Come True is an extensive investigation of the working relationship between two revered artists, David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti, as an insightful collage that bridges the gap between academic analysis and investigative journalism. The working-relationship between director David Lynch and composer Angelo Badalamenti is one of the most fruitful and celebrated in cinema history. Yet despite their success and fame, this is the first book written about their decades-long collaboration. It offers new, valuable insights to fans of both Lynch's and Badalamenti's work. The book analyses David Lynch the filmmaker through the lens of Angelo Badalamenti's music via extensive creative biographies of both, in-depth investigations into how the individual music pieces and scores came to be, how they were altered and changed during the editing process, and what clues both music and sound design can give to unlock the mysteries of individual works. It includes several of their collaborations, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, The Straight Story, and Mulholland Drive, among others. The result is an insightful collage of exclusive interviews with many of Lynch's and Badalamenti's colleagues and friends, transcribed music examples, direct quotes, previously unpublished photographs, dialogue taken from the films, and a careful examination of secondary-sometimes contradictory-sources. More than 15 industry professionals, including Oscar-winning sound designer Randy Thom, music editor Lori Eschler, music editor and composer John Neff, musician Barry Adamson, PA John Wentworth and film director Mark Pellington share their experiences and insights in exclusive interviews. For each film, an analysis of both music and sound design reveals how the use of these twin elements helps establish and amplify moods and emotions, and how they serve as keys to interpret the individual films and TV shows.",['Performing Arts'],"['New Release', 'Performing Arts']",new_releases,JeV-EQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Beyond the Facts,James W. Cortada,,9798216196020,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,147,0.0,0,"This book describes tacit knowledge, what it is, how it used and its role in our current data driven world. It argues that fuzzy, hard-to describe information is greater and more, important than just hard facts. What is tacit knowledge? It is what we might consider knowledge that is unable to be fully communicated; knowledge that we understand implicitly, but it is a bit hard to explain. For example, it is the kind of knowledge one needs to ride a bicycle, but that cannot be described precisely on paper in the way one might be able to explain how to cook a dish. Tacit knowledge is the least understood type of information and one of the most difficult to communicate. Yet there is more tacit knowledge in our lives than the specific facts one can find in a book, on the Internet or in the simple form of a fact. This book is designed to introduce the reader to the concept of tacit knowledge and how to recognize and use it. This book offers definitions of tacit knowledge and compares the topic to explicit knowledge, then describes how the former is used today. The author argues that both types are used today and explains how one can use both types of knowledge in their lives. Topics include: - The role of tacit knowledge in business and government; - The wide use of Knowledge Management techniques in tacit knowledge and the newly emerging set of ideas quietly spreading in the workplace called Critical Systems Thinking; - How one can understand and apply tacit knowledge; - How AI can apply tacit knowledge; - And more. This book is essential primer to understanding tacit knowledge, and learning how to use it to your advantage.",['History'],"['New Release', 'History']",new_releases,lruBEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Allie Catt, caterer and personal chef in the beautiful mountain community of Asheville, North Carolina, has devised a winning formula by using her clients’ favorite books as inspiration.

The technology for such weapons has been under development since at least the 1960s. The first covert attacks on U.S. diplomats may go back to that time when the phenomenon was called the “Moscow Signal.” Havana Syndrome: A Threat to National Security covers the history of anti-personnel directed-energy weapons (DEW) from the Soviet psychotronic weapons that were rumored to exist since the 1970s to the nonlethal weapons developed in the West in the 1980s onward. The book examines the publicly known details of Havana Syndrome and provides some analysis of the U.S. government investigations into Havana Syndrome with respect to what has been declassified. The most likely perpetrators are the Russian or Chinese governments, as some incidents seem to be related to their strategic interests, and as both would have the technology to carry out such sophisticated attacks.

However, the reality in Russia is starkly different: censorship has long been a tool for political control, particularly since the end of the 18th century. With the war in Ukraine, these evolving mechanisms of censorship have become a penal system for retribution and control over personal freedoms. This book examines this critical moment, while highlighting that censorship in Russia predates Putin's regime. It explores both external and internal forms of censorship, including the actions of individual artists and state-sanctioned protests by far-right groups.

They’re the oddballs of the Round Table, like Sir Palomides, the Saracen Knight, and Sir Dagonet, Arthur’s fool, who was knighted as a joke. They’re joined by Nimue, who was Merlin’s apprentice until she turned on him and buried him under a hill. But it's up to them to rebuild Camelot in a world that has lost its balance, even as God abandons Britain and the fairies and old gods return, led by Morgan le Fay. They must reclaim Excalibur and make this ruined world whole again—but first they'll have to solve the mystery of why the lonely, brilliant King Arthur fell. The first major Arthurian epic of the new millennium, The Bright Sword is steeped in tradition, complete with duels and quests, battles and tournaments, magic swords and Fisher Kings. It's also a story about imperfect men and women, full of strength and pain, trying to reforge a broken land in spite of being broken themselves.",['Fiction'],"['New Release', 'Fiction']",new_releases,nI5UEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Years later, she’s perhaps the most hated—and least understood—woman in music.

Charming, smart, heart-blistering, and heart-healing.” —Danez Smith, The New York Times Book Review “We all need—we all deserve—this vibrant, love-affirming novel that bounds over any difference that claims to separate us.” —Ron Charles, The Washington Post From James McBride, author of the bestselling Oprah’s Book Club pick Deacon King Kong and the National Book Award–winning The Good Lord Bird, a novel about small-town secrets and the people who keep them In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. As these characters’ stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community—heaven and earth—that sustain us. Bringing his masterly storytelling skills and his deep faith in humanity to The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, James McBride has written a novel as compassionate as Deacon King Kong and as inventive as The Good Lord Bird.",['Fiction'],"['New Release', 'Fiction']",new_releases,OANjEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Examining the origin stories of the orc, which changed over time according to Tolkien's own worries about whether orcs were ""redeemable,"" this book endeavors to show that these ""inhuman"" creatures are, in fact, among the most human (perhaps ""all-too-human"") to be found in The Lord of the Rings. This work discusses racism and class hierarchies in Tolkien's writings, contexts in which the characterization of orcs is particularly noticeable. But Tolkien's own writings reveal the nature of orcs to be worthy of sympathy, despite their often dehumanized or demonized depictions. Focusing on key scenes from The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings, this study uncovers the richly diverse cultures, as well as the distinctive personalities of various orcs, who turn out to be a far cry from the monsters they are taken to be in the popular imagination.

Spies in European Culture, 1815-1914 sheds light on the founding moment of espionage and the use of secrecy in politics in the contemporary age. It successfully argues that the 19th century saw the development of a cultural-historical process in which disruptive novelties like the disguise, the secret and the double identity simultaneously assailed the spheres of the state, the self and the imaginary, ushering in distinctive features of society in the modern era in the process.

Speculative Orientalism: Asian Religions in New Wave Science Fiction,Sang-Keun Yoo,1350447927,9781350447929,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing,249,0.0,0,"Examining the works of prominent New Wave science fiction authors from the 1950-1960s, Sang-Keun Yoo highlights the underexplored connection between American science fiction and Asian religions, such as Taoism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.The book considers how the major world wars of the 20th century-Second World War, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War- repositioned Asian culture in relation to the science fiction genre in the period. Underpinning this study, Sang-Keun Yoo argues that “Speculative Orientalism” emerged in American science fiction during the 1950s and 60s. This concept adopted various aspects of Asian religions to envision alternative worlds, unburdened by the constraints of colonialism, totalitarianism, racism, and sexism present in contemporary American society. Bringing fresh perspectives to the works of William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin and Samuel R. Delany, this book offers an insightful examination of the role of Asian religions in American science fiction and their impact on the genre's history.",['Religion'],"['New Release', 'Religion']",new_releases,XbJfEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine . . . ."" - Dr. John H. Watson So wrote Dr. Watson in ""The Problem of Thor Bridge"" - and ever since, Sherlockians have been bringing us new adventures from this legendary tin dispatch box. While Watson's original First Literary Agent only edited the pitifully few sixty stories that make up the original Canon, there have since been literally thousands of traditional adventures about the true Sherlock Holmes - and there will never be enough! In 2015, The MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories burst upon the scene, featuring adventures set within the correct time period, and written by many of today's leading Sherlockian authors from around the world. Those first three volumes were overwhelmingly received, and there were soon calls for additional collections. Since then, their popularity has only continued to grow. Now, ten years later, the series draws to a close, having grown to 52 massive volumes and over 1,000 stories. Along the way, the author royalties from these books, featuring stories and poems from over 200 contributors worldwide, has raised over $135,000 for the Undershaw school for special needs children, located at one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's former homes. The 81 thrilling stories in these four companion volumes - Parts 49, 50, 51, and 52 - feature Holmes and Watson carrying out their masterful investigations from the early days of their friendship in Baker Street to the post-War years during Holmes's retirement. Along the way, Our Heroes are involved in a plethora of fascinating mysteries - some relating Untold Cases, others sequels to Canonical adventures, and a number of others that progress along completely unexpected lines. Join us as we return to Baker Street and discover more authentic adventures of Sherlock Holmes, described by the estimable Dr. Watson as ""the best and wisest . . . whom I have ever known.""",['Fiction'],"['New Release', 'Fiction']",new_releases,z0RZEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Gender nonconformity and sexual dissidence on the African continent has produced a lexical culture at the crossroads of Western discourse and local African naming practices. Transafrica is an unprecedented attempt at identifying the new vocabularies which queer and transgender Africans have used in the first two decades of the 21st century to refer to themselves and narrativize their desire, in the face of official narratives by medical doctors, and legal and religious authorities that have often been prioritized over a gender-variant (queer, trans, non-binary) individual's lived experience, resulting in a systemic disempowerment. Using case studies from Morocco, Egypt, Somalia, Nigeria, Uganda, Madagascar, Botswana, South Africa and more, Transafrica draws conclusions for a culture-specific and history-specific type of gender diversity outside of Western epistemic borders while confronting Euro-American models, thereby auguring a turn-of-the-third-millennium postqueer set of African open-ended identities.",['Political Science'],"['New Release', 'Political Science']",new_releases,15YzEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Two brothers must come together to solve the Mardi Gras murder of the most popular girl in school after one of them is caught fleeing the scene of her death. Amir Trudeau only goes to his half brother Marcel’s birthday party because of Chloe Danvers. Chloe is rich, and hot, and fits right into the perfect life Marcel inherited when their father left Amir’s mother to start a new family with Marcel’s mom. But Chloe is hot enough for Amir to forget that for one night. Does she want to hook up? Or is she trying to meddle in the estranged brothers’ messy family drama? Amir can’t tell.

The rise of fake news has introduced serious vulnerabilities into supply chains, causing misinformation-driven disruptions, damaged reputations, and shaken consumer confidence. These effects can ripple across industries, triggering shortages, price volatility, and long-term economic instability. Understanding how misinformation spreads and impacts each link in the supply chain is essential for building resilient, transparent, and responsive systems. Tackling this issue requires collaboration among businesses, governments, and the public to improve media literacy, promote transparency, and develop effective countermeasures.

On Being Nonreligious in Contemporary Japan,"Ian Reader, Clark Chilson",1350541516,9781350541511,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing,183,0.0,0,"Challenging the notion of the nonreligious in Japan being religious through tradition and institution, this book demonstrates how negativity and antipathy for religion relate to religious decline in Japan today. Why do most Japanese say they are 'nonreligious' (mushukyo)? Since the 1990s, scholars have answered this key question for understanding religion in contemporary Japan as follows: although the Japanese say they are nonreligious because they do not identify with a particular religious tradition or institution, they are in fact religious through their traditional practices; New Year's visits to shinto Shrines, Buddhist mortuary rites and festivals (matsuri) are typically seen as customs rather than as religious. Challenging this answer, this book argues that many Japanese say they are nonreligious because they actually dislike religion and want to distance themselves from it. To support this argument, the book explores how religion is in decline in Japan today. Demonstrating how negative images of religion are produced in the mainstream media, in popular culture, and by various groups and people, this book also explores specific case studies such as anti-cult organizations, lawyers, government agencies, intellectuals, and religious organizations. Ian Reader and Clark Chilson argue that popular negative images and perceptions about religion create an 'ecology of dislike', which encourages disassociation from religion and exacerbates problems for religions today. Overall, this book provides a new perspective on religion in contemporary Japan that has implications for our understanding of secularization in the modern world.",['Religion'],"['New Release', 'Religion']",new_releases,UMdWEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

It underscores the intrigue and authority of the British royals, revealing the fine balance between public visibility and the maintenance of mystique that has been pivotal to their enduring presence. Popular culture is a powerful lens through which to view the monarchy. As cultural industries have shifted over time, so too has the portrayal of the royals. The British royal family has continually navigated the complexities of celebrity culture. Through curated public appearances and carefully staged ceremonies, the royals have maintained their iconic status, bolstering the monarchy’s enduring appeal and cultural significance, while maintaining a mystique essential for ongoing fascination. With the death of Elizabeth II and the coronation of Charles III, this book emphasizes a renewed global interest in assessing how royals occupy cultural and social spaces. It invites readers to critically examine why in a contemporary world, where many sovereigns live largely out of the public eye, the British royals remain a captivating subject of public gaze. Ultimately, this book highlights how the British royal family has evolved through popular culture, transforming from a historical institution into a global brand. By unpacking the fantasy and reality of the monarchy, it reveals how the royals navigate their roles, maintain their influence, and continually engage with society. In examining how they are fashioned and perceived through various cultural dimensions – from media to fashion, and weddings to state occasions – the text paints a comprehensive portrait of how the British monarchy has persisted through ongoing reinvention and adaptation.",['History'],"['New Release', 'History']",new_releases,TwhYEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Why Sinéad O'Connor Matters,Allyson McCabe,1477330739,9781477330739,2024,University of Texas Press,230,0.0,0,"""Irish singer-songwriter Sinéad O'Connor burst onto the pop scene in 1987 with her album The Lion and the Cobra, and followed it with the Grammy-winning I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (1990), which featured a cover of Prince's song ""Nothing Compares 2 U."" In 1992, she infamously tore a picture of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live to protest the sexual abuse committed by priests and covered up by church authorities. O'Connor was immediately castigated for her politics, which were already radical, and her career has suffered ever since. For many people-including, for many years, the author-what they know of O'Connor stops there. Allyson McCabe argues that both that moment and O'Connor's long career deserve re-examination. For McCabe, hindsight suggests that O'Connor ""was right."" Right about the church, right about how the music industry uses women, and ""most of all, she was right to seek and speak her own truth"" no matter the price she's paid for it. O'Connor continues to be controversial, with public breakdowns and problematic statements (to say nothing of changing her name twice). She also has released 10 albums in addition to one-off collaborations and singles. She is a hero (as this book makes clear) to Fiona Apple and other influential women in music. McCabe plans to address both triumphs and struggles, to offer ""a fresh look at Sinéad O'Connor's life through the lenses of music criticism, cultural analysis, and personal reflection."" The book works through O'Connor's life and career in chronological order, from her abused childhood to initial success, stardom, and the ensuing fallout. McCabe compares O'Connor with Madonna, digs into how she aspires to be a protest singer rather than a pop star, and McCabe explores O'Connor's attempts to de-stigmatize mental illness""--",['Music'],"['New Release', 'Music']",new_releases,rLgFEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Hausa Cinema of Northern Nigeria,Abdalla Uba Adamu,,9798765154434,2025,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,421,0.0,0,"This historical account of cinema in Nigeria explores the transcultural transfer of media from India to Africa through films. Hausa Cinema of Northern Nigeria examines how the Hindi Cinema of India became the template for storytelling in the Hausa regional cinema of Northern Nigeria and explores the emergence of Indigenous language within cinema in this region. Such emergence created points of divergence with the Islamic public culture leading to censorship both within the entertainment industry and the newly re-introduced Shari'a government of Kano. Throughout this book, Abdalla Uba Adamu explores the tension between Islamic society and the intrusion of transglobal media influences in cinema in Kano. He provides a deeper understanding of global media transnationalism and its impact on Muslim African popular culture. This book also discusses how the Muslim Hausa youth used the agencies of transglobal media technologies to transform the Hausa narrative style from a linear and didactic format to a complex configuration. By examining the Hausa film industry' s history, Adamu challenges the notion of cultural and media imperialism and the dominance of media consumption in contemporary African societies.",['Political Science'],"['New Release', 'Political Science']",new_releases,M-1YEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

""The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre is, shockingly, little more than a footnote in history . . . Miller's book, thankfully, reverses that egregious oversight . . . we viscerally learn how this vibrant Black community fought devastation with resilience, faith, and grit."" --Jodi Picoult, #1 New York Times bestselling author Two sisters. One unassuming haven. Endless opportunities for grace. Sisters Margaret and Evelyn Justice have grown up in the prosperous Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma--also known as Black Wall Street. In Greenwood, the Justice sisters had it all--movie theaters and entertainment venues, beauty shops and clothing stores, high-profile businesses like law offices, medical clinics, and banks. While Evelyn aspires to head off to the East Coast to study fashion design, recent college grad Margaret plans to settle in Greenwood, teaching at the local high school and eventually raising a family. Then the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre upends everything they know and brings them unspeakable loss. Left with nothing but each other, the sisters flee along what would eventually become iconic Route 66 and stumble upon the Threatt Filling Station, a safe haven and the only place where they can find a shred of hope in oppressive Jim Crow America. At the filling station, they are able to process their pain, fill up their souls, and find strength as they wrestle with a faith in God that has left them feeling abandoned. But they eventually realize that they can't hide out at the filling station when Greenwood needs to be rebuilt. The search for their father and their former life may not give them easy answers, but it can propel them--and their community--to a place where their voices are stronger . . . strong enough to build a future that honors the legacy of those who were lost.

Why do both writers and scholars of Indian English literature express resistance to India and Indianness? What does this reveal about how non-Western literatures are read, taught, and understood? Drawing on years of experiences in classrooms and on U.S. university campuses, Ragini Tharoor Srinivasan explores how writers, critics, teachers, and students of Indian English literatures negotiate and resist the categories through which the field is defined: ethnic, postcolonial, and Anglophone. Overdetermined considers major contemporary authors who disavow identity even as their works and public personas respond in varied ways to the imperatives of being “Indian.” Chapters examine Bharati Mukherjee’s rejection of “ethnic” Americanness; Chetan Bhagat’s “bad English”; Amit Chaudhuri’s autofictional literary project; and Jhumpa Lahiri’s decision to write in Italian, interspersed with meditations on the iconicity of the theorists Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Homi Bhabha, and Edward Said. Through an innovative method of accented reading and sharing stories and syllabi from her teaching, Srinivasan relates the burdens of representation faced by ethnic and postcolonial writers to the institutional and disciplinary pressures that affect the scholars who study their works. Engaging and self-reflexive, Overdetermined offers new insight into the dynamics that shape contemporary Indian English literature, the politics of identity in literary studies, and the complexities of teaching minoritized literatures in the West.",['Literary Criticism'],"['New Release', 'Literary Criticism']",new_releases,nVtSEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

According to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, and more, the only good future for humanity is one powered by technology: trillions of humans living in space, functionally immortal, served by superintelligent AIs. In More Everything Forever, science journalist Adam Becker investigates these wildly implausible and often profoundly immoral visions of tomorrow—and shows why, in reality, there is no good evidence that they will, or should, come to pass. Nevertheless, these obsessions fuel fears that overwhelm reason—for example, that a rogue AI will exterminate humanity—at the expense of essential work on solving crucial problems like climate change. What’s more, these futuristic visions cloak a hunger for power under dreams of space colonies and digital immortality. The giants of Silicon Valley claim that their ideas are based on science, but the reality is darker: they come from a jumbled mix of shallow futurism and racist pseudoscience. More Everything Forever exposes the powerful and sinister ideas that dominate Silicon Valley, challenging us to see how foolish, and dangerous, these visions of the future are.",['Business & Economics'],"['New Release', 'Business & Economics']",new_releases,MDoGEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN • OUR CULTURE • SO MANY DAMN BOOKS • CLIMATE & CAPITAL MEDIA ""[Plastic] deserves applause....Raises urgent questions about climate change, political violence, and spirituality with high intelligence....Wondrous."" - The New York Times Book Review Erin is a plastic girl living in a plastic world. Every day she eats a breakfast of boiled chicken, then conveys her articulated body to Tablet Town, where she sells other figurines Smartbodies: wearable tech that allows full, physical immersion in a virtual world, a refuge from real life’s brutal wars, oppressive governmental monitoring, and omnipresent eco-terrorist insurgency. If you cut her, she will not bleed—but she and her fellow figurines can still be cracked or blown apart by gunfire or bombs, or crumble away from nuclear fallout. Erin, who's lost her father, sister, and the love of her life, certainly knows plenty about death. An attack at her place of work brings Erin another too-intimate experience, but it also brings her Jacob: a blind figurine whom she comforts in the aftermath, and with whom she feels an almost instant connection. For the first time in years, Erin begins to experience hope—hope that until now she's only gleaned from watching her favorite TV show, the surrealist retro sitcom “Nuclear Family.” Exploring the wild wonders of the virtual reality landscape together, it seems that possibly, slowly, Erin and Jacob may have a chance at healing from their trauma. But then secrets from Erin's family's past begin to invade her carefully constructed reality, and cracks in the facade she's constructed around her life threaten to reveal everything vulnerable beneath. Both a crypto-comedic dystopian fantasy and a deadly serious dissection of our own farcical pre-apocalypse, Scott Guild’s debut novel is an achingly beautiful, disarmingly welcoming, and fabulously inventive look at the hollow core of modern American society—and a guide to how we might reanimate all its broken plastic pieces.",['Fiction'],"['New Release', 'Fiction']",new_releases,07YhEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Some children are made in factories, from cells of rabbits and dolphins; some live by getting nutrients from water and light, like plants.

It theorizes what it means for a work to be called immersive and how immersion impacts audience experience in each of these modes. The presentation of story is deepened when it involves the spectator in an immersive way. Author Kelly I. Aliano concentrates on the central idea that the use of immersion in each medium allows the story being told to feel present for the spectator. It puts them at the center of the experience, making its events for and about them. Throughout, the book discusses how immersion is employed to make narrative feel more resonant and relevant for the audience. Analyzing the impact of offering a first-hand experience of story events, this book looks at how immersive storytelling can highlight the ways in which we can interact with and shape our understandings of ourselves and our society as well as our histories and identities. Ideal for students, scholars, and researchers of immersive theatre, spectatorship, museum studies, and video game studies, this is an innovative study into the power of immersive storytelling across three interactive mediums.",['Performing Arts'],"['New Release', 'Performing Arts']",new_releases,0Co9EQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

The discussions of interconnections between poetry on the one hand and physics, biology, biochemistry and pharmacology on the other hand stress that common ground can be found among diverse disciplines and transdisciplinary solutions can be offered to wicked problems. The relation between science and transdisciplinarity and other knowledge systems, including arts and literature, should be supported. Novel thinking, mixing and merging disciplines creating a third space and realizing new findings should relate academy to society. Therefore, researchers and transdisciplinarians should focus on the power that can reshape the world transcending traditional academic confines. Raising questions that can lead to deeply philosophical and scientific disputes develops solutions for wicked problems and creates an ongoing encounter on all solutions.

It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine . . . ."" - Dr. John H. Watson So wrote Dr. Watson in ""The Problem of Thor Bridge"" - and ever since, Sherlockians have been bringing us new adventures from this legendary tin dispatch box. While Watson's original First Literary Agent only edited the pitifully few sixty stories that make up the original Canon, there have since been literally thousands of traditional adventures about the true Sherlock Holmes - and there will never be enough! In 2015, The MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories burst upon the scene, featuring adventures set within the correct time period, and written by many of today's leading Sherlockian authors from around the world. Those first three volumes were overwhelmingly received, and there were soon calls for additional collections. Since then, their popularity has only continued to grow. Now, ten years later, the series draws to a close, having grown to 52 massive volumes and over 1,000 stories. Along the way, the author royalties from these books, featuring stories and poems from over 200 contributors worldwide, has raised over $135,000 for the Undershaw school for special needs children, located at one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's former homes. The 81 thrilling stories in these four companion volumes - Parts 49, 50, 51, and 52 - feature Holmes and Watson carrying out their masterful investigations from the early days of their friendship in Baker Street to the post-War years during Holmes's retirement. Along the way, Our Heroes are involved in a plethora of fascinating mysteries - some relating Untold Cases, others sequels to Canonical adventures, and a number of others that progress along completely unexpected lines.

The focus of representation is the long nineteenth century – a period from the early republic to World War I – as a key epoch of the nation-building project of the United States. The study explores the constructedness of historical tradition and the cultural resonance of historical events within the discourse on the contemporary novel and the theory formation surrounding it. At the center of the discussion are the unprecedented literary output and critical as well as popular success of historical fiction in the USA since 1995. An additional postcolonial and transatlantic perspective is provided by the incorporation of texts by British and Australian authors and especially by the inclusion of insights from neo-Victorian studies. The book provides a critical comment on current and topical developments in American literature, culture, and historiography.",['Fiction'],"['Crime', 'Thriller', 'Fiction']",crime,FS0hEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

This book aims to contribute to the field of global literary studies with a more inclusive and decentralising approach. Specifically, it responds to a double demand: the need for expanding openness to other ways of seeing the global literary space by including multiple literary and cultural traditions and other interdisciplinary perspectives in the discussion, and the need for conceptual models and different case studies that will help develop a global approach in four key avenues of research: global translation flows and translation policies, the post-1989 novel as a global form, global literary environments, and a global perspective on film and cinema history. Gathering contributions from international scholars with expertise in various areas of research, the volume is structured around five target concepts: space, scale, time, connectivity, and agency.

The story of rich kids, flagrant excess, and multiple murders fascinated the American public, but deeper truths lay buried beneath. The saga was so complex that neither its scope nor its implications could be clearly discerned—that is, until The Price of Experience was published in 1996. A scholarship student with a strange father and a mysterious background, Joe was socially shunned at the ultra-elite Harvard School in Los Angeles. By age twenty, however, Joe had made and lost $14 million on Chicago’s commodities exchange. Back in L.A., he dazzled former classmates with his power and confidence, assembling them into the BBC Consolidated of North America, Inc. – part corporate empire and part private social club. Joe convinced the children of L.A.’s most powerful families that all the wealth, status, and power in the world was theirs for the taking. They gave him their trust funds and a loyalty he transformed into cultish devotion. Hunt and the BBC became the talk of L.A. – not only for the meteoric rise that brought them control of more than $100 million in assets, but for the grisly murders connected to the group. As the group’s deadly momentum increased and its business dealings spun out of control, BBC members began to talk, and eventually Hunt and four others were arrested on two counts of murder. In this utterly gripping narrative, award-winning journalist Randall Sullivan finally revealed the whole story. Now, in the new afterword, he returns to Joe Hunt—who has now been in prison for almost forty years—and recounts the fates of his accomplices. This is a landmark true-crime book with a diabolical, but almost irresistibly seductive, genius at its center.",['True Crime'],"['Crime', 'Thriller', 'True Crime']",crime,8POFEQAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

It presents information in an accessible style, balancing scholarly rigor with engaging prose. The structure progresses from a historical foundation to a detailed analysis of the craft of mystery writing, culminating in an exploration of the psychological dimensions of puzzle-solving.

The Gentrification Plot,Thomas Heise,023155348X,9780231553483,2021,Columbia University Press,197,0.0,0,"For decades, crime novelists have set their stories in New York City, a place long famed for decay, danger, and intrigue. What happens when the mean streets of the city are no longer quite so mean? In the wake of an unprecedented drop in crime in the 1990s and the real-estate development boom in the early 2000s, a new suspect is on the scene: gentrification. Thomas Heise identifies and investigates the emerging “gentrification plot” in contemporary crime fiction. He considers recent novels that depict the sweeping transformations of five iconic neighborhoods—the Lower East Side, Chinatown, Red Hook, Harlem, and Bedford-Stuyvesant—that have been central to African American, Latinx, immigrant, and blue-collar life in the city. Heise reads works by Richard Price, Henry Chang, Gabriel Cohen, Reggie Nadelson, Ivy Pochoda, Grace Edwards, Ernesto Quiñonez, Wil Medearis, and Brian Platzer, tracking their representations of “broken-windows” policing, cultural erasure, racial conflict, class grievance, and displacement. Placing their novels in conversation with oral histories, urban planning, and policing theory, he explores crime fiction’s contradictory and ambivalent portrayals of the postindustrial city’s dizzying metamorphoses while underscoring the material conditions of the genre. A timely and powerful book, The Gentrification Plot reveals how today’s crime writers narrate the death—or murder—of a place and a way of life.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Crime', 'Thriller', 'Literary Criticism']",crime,uBYrEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

Italian Crime Fiction in the Era of the Anti-Mafia Movement,William Farina,1476677352,9781476677354,2020,McFarland,235,0.0,0,"Over the last three decades, Italian crime fiction has demonstrated a trend toward a much higher level of realism and complexity. The origins of the New Italian Epic, as it has been coined by some of its proponents, can be found in the widespread backlash against the Mafia-sponsored murders of Sicilian magistrates which culminated with the assassinations of Judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992. Though beginning in the Italian language, this prolific, popular movement has more recently found its way into the English language and hence it has found a much wider international audience. Following a brief, yet detailed, history of the cultural and economic development of Sicily, this book provides a multilayered look into the evolution of the New Italian Epic genre. The works of ten prominent contemporary writers, including Andrea Camilleri, Michael Dibdin, Elena Ferrante, and Massimo Carlotto, are examined against the backdrop of various historical periods.

Studying Crime in Fiction,Eric Sandberg,1003838367,9781003838364,2024,Taylor & Francis,184,0.0,0,"The primary aim of Studying Crime in Fiction: An Introduction is to introduce the emerging cross-disciplinary area of study that combines the fields of crime fiction studies and criminology. The study of crime fiction as a genre has a long history within literary studies, and is becoming increasingly prominent in twenty-first-century scholarship. Less attention, however, has been paid to the ways in which elements of criminology, or the systematic study of crime and criminal behaviour from a wide range of perspectives, have influenced the production and reception of crime narratives. Similarly, not enough attention has been paid to the ways in which crime fiction as a genre can inform and enliven the study of criminology. Written largely for undergraduate and graduate students, but also for scholars of crime fiction and criminology interested in thinking across disciplinary boundaries, Studying Crime in Fiction: An Introduction provides full coverage of the backgrounds of the related fields of crime fiction studies and criminology, and explores the many ways they are reciprocally illuminating. The four main chapters in Section 1 (Orient You) familiarize readers with the history and contours of the broad fields within which Studying Crime in Fiction: An Introduction operates. It introduces the history of crime and criminology, as well the history of crime fiction and the academic field dedicated to its study. In its final chapter it looks at the ways these areas of study can be conceptually interrelated. Section 2 of the book (Equip You) is dedicated to examining aspects of criminological theory in relation to various forms of crime fiction. It highlights a range of the most relevant theories, paradigms, and problematics of criminology that appear in, shed light on, or can be effectively illuminated through reference to crime fiction. Its five chapters deal with the definition of crime; explanations for crime and criminal behaviour; investigations into crime; the experience of crime; and, finally, punishments for crime. All of these areas are examined alongside examples of crime fiction drawn from across the genre’s history. Section 3 (Enable You) presents six case studies. Each of these reads a work of crime fiction alongside one or more criminological approaches. Each case study is supplemented with a set of questions addressing issues central to the study of crime in fiction.",['Fiction'],"['Crime', 'Thriller', 'Fiction']",crime,MN_pEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

It discusses novels written by five authors: David Downing, Philip Kerr, Luke McCallin, Joseph Kanon and David Thomas. Their work belongs to a subgenre of the historical crime novel that has emerged since the late 1980s to become a significant body of writing located at the intersection of crime fiction and Holocaust literature. The readings of these novels explore questions of form and genre to ask how popular fiction might approach the Holocaust. Themes of resistance and complicity and the relationship between them, and problems of guilt and responsibility are also discussed. This book also explores questions of justice to show how these novels explore social and moral justice, and vengeance and revenge, as alternatives to ordinary legal justice after the Holocaust.",['Literary Criticism'],"['Crime', 'Thriller', 'Literary Criticism']",crime,MqzBEAAAQBAJ,,0,,[],0.0

In Intentional Acts (Book 12), Sasha and Leo find themselves on opposite sides of an explosive situation. Sasha's up to her elbows in a data privacy matter. Her client could be on the hook for breaching the privacy of hundreds of customers. All because a rogue employee intentionally leaked personal information for reasons known only to him. Leo's busy with a high-stakes case of his own. He's been ordered to neutralize a national security threat, but he has his doubts about the strength of the evidence against the target. As Leo vets the information he's been given, Sasha learns that federal law enforcement has an interest in her civil matter. Because they both take their duties of confidentiality seriously, neither realizes that their cases are intertwined. Until one of the affected customers in Sasha's case is murdered … and the evidence points to Leo as the killer. Sasha’s not about to turn in her own husband, so she tails him. She only hopes what she finds will clear his name, not destroy their marriage. In In Absentia (Book 12), nothing will stop Sasha from finding her missing client—not even a violent terrorist cell, a trained assassin, and an opioid-trafficking ring. When Sasha's client is a no-show for his federal sentencing hearing in a bulk money smuggling case, the presiding judge is not amused. He gives her the weekend to locate the guy or face the consequences. She tracks the client to a remote West Virginia town, but it's not the end of her problems—it's just the beginning. He's being held hostage by violent men convinced he's the key to eight million dollars missing from a terrorist organization's coffers. After a day passes with no word from Sasha, an increasingly worried Leo leaves the kids with a friend and heads to West Virginia to search for her. He finds himself in the middle of a massive drug-trafficking investigation. Cut off from one another and from any means of communication and surrounded by players who aren't who they seem to be, Sasha and Leo each figure out half of the story. Now, they're running out of time to put it all together. Echoes of grief and pain reverberate across the decades in Inevitable Discovery (Book 13). On November 20, 1999, a phone call shattered Sasha McCandless' family with the news that her brother Patrick had been shot and killed. Exactly twenty years later, another middle of the night phone call thrusts Sasha into a dangerous new case. A protest over the death of a young man at the hands of the Milltown Police ends with several protestors being snatched off the street by a group of black-clad armed men. Sasha agrees to represent three of the detainees in a case against the police department and the secretive organization that abducted them. As her investigation heats up, she becomes a target. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a college student brings her past crashing into the present. Her search for the truth will reopen old wounds and cause fresh pain. Get cozy with Full Fathom Five (Book 13.5), a McCandless-Connelly Family Mystery Novella! It's the week after Christmas, and the McCandless-Connelly family is snowed in. Really snowed in. Roads are closed. Stores are closed. A curfew is in place. And Sasha and Leo's five-year-old twins are climbing the walls.

This book is based on a pilot project funded by the Aston Institute for Forensic Linguistics, entitled 'Genre, Pacing, and Narrative in Police Missing Persons Appeals' (Aug 2021-Nov 2022). The authors identify a missing persons appeal as a literary and linguistic genre in its own right and illustrate the problems that arise when the appeals writing process goes unregulated or unstudied: there is currently little-to-no official, national police guidance, regulation, or standard procedure for writing a missing persons appeal in the UK. The authors also identify opportunities for improving the writing and delivery of appeals by further (and more intentionally) applying crime fiction conventions, narrative devices, and pacing, to maximise audience reach and increase the chances of recovering a missing person.

When you're a child of the favela, in the Valley of Steel, you know that Fate comes like a whirlwind, lifting some to great heights and slapping others down with no reason. Ivan, rescued first from an orphanage in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and then from the bleak streets of Ipatinga in Brazil's Valley of Steel, has been favored by Fate. When a call from Brazil interrupts his privileged life in America, he learns his best friend has committed suicide in the rugged Valley of Steel and only he knows the real reasons why. This is the story of one man's journey home after a self-inflicted exile. The story of a boy who saw more than any child should, and the man he grew into--and how that man came back to the Valley of Steel to avenge his childhood and stare down the demons of his past. It is a story of survival, redemption, and joy. Of childhood memories that burn in the soul--and what happens when one man has courage enough to fan the flames and face the fire.

Barri Flowers,146,0.0,0,"MURDER IN MAUI: A Leila Kahana Mystery is a police procedural medical mystery novel set in the lush, deceptively idyllic tropical paradise of Hawaii. Maui County homicide detective and composite sketch artist Leila Kahana is the protagonist. A Hawaiian native, Leila follows in the footsteps of her grandfather who was the County of Maui police chief. She is tough, smart, sexy, and outspoken. Leila’s partner is Detective Sergeant Blake Seymour, separated from his wife and pushing to make lieutenant. Leila and Seymour investigate the execution-style murder of two prominent doctors in an upscale condominium. Larry Nagasaka and Elizabeth Racine are found lying naked in bed in a pool of their own blood. It is learned that they are married, but not to each other, and that the doctors belong to a prestigious medical association. Assisting the detectives in the case are fellow members of the homicide squad, Detectives Trent Ferguson and Rachel Lancaster, run by Lieutenant Paul Ortega who is contemplating retirement. As they interview suspects and collect evidence, more doctors belonging to the medical association are murdered, making it clear to all that they have a ruthless and determined serial killer on their hands. Leila, attempting to step out of the shadow of her grandfather and prove her worth to a skeptical Polynesian mother, is determined to solve this case, made more difficult as all the victims have skeletons in their closets. Leila’s romantic involvement with Seymour, in spite of her conservative upbringing and the fact that he still pines for his soon-to-be ex-wife, complicates matters. What sets this series apart--aside from the lush setting of Maui and its distinct areas that are prominent in the book such as Wailuku, Lahaina, Kihei, and Napili--is the colorful main characters as they painstakingly go through the process of stopping a ruthless killer, with everyone a suspect.

The first section of the book is primarily theoretical. It offers a bibliographical survey and then explains why we so profoundly enjoy these suspenseful films of murder and intrigue. A chapter on ""Thrills: or, How Objects and Empty Spaces Compete to Threaten Us"" explores the psychological concept of the thrill and relates it to the psyche of the spectator. To what extent does the suspense thriller represent a symbolic and vicarious experience of danger? A chapter on ""Suspense That Makes the Spectator Take a Breath"" explores the crucial narrative concept of suspense and relates it to the psychological mechanisms of anxiety incited in the spectator. Why do we like to be scared? A final theoretical chapter offers a dynamic definition of the suspense thriller derived in part from Edgar Allan Poe and based primarily on content analysis. The second section of the book is more of an historical survey and devotes one chapter to each of the suspense thriller's primary sub-genres. These chapters provide close readings of more than 150 major films and detailed analysis of the suspense thriller's conventions, themes, and recurrent iconography. Sub-genres include The Postman Always Rings Twice, Body Heat, The Manchurian Candidate, The China Syndrome, Missing, The Passenger, Spellbound, Obsession, Marathon Man and Blue Velvet. A final chapter explores areas for further research and offers concluding insights.",['Performing Arts'],"['Suspense', 'Thriller', 'Performing Arts']",suspense,GqExHkQU63wC,,0,,[],0.0

When the shocking news breaks that Justice Wynn--the cantankerous swing vote on many current high-profile cases--has slipped into a coma, Avery's life turns upside down. She is immediately notified that Justice Wynn has left instructions for her to serve as his legal guardian and power of attorney. Plunged into an explosive role she never anticipated, Avery finds that Justice Wynn had been secretly researching one of the most controversial cases before the court--a proposed merger between an American biotech company and an Indian genetics firm, which promises to unleash breathtaking results in the medical field. She also discovers that Wynn suspected a dangerously related conspiracy that infiltrates the highest power corridors of Washington. As political wrangling ensues in Washington to potentially replace the ailing judge whose life and survival Avery controls, she begins to unravel a carefully constructed, chesslike sequence of clues left behind by Wynn. She comes to see that Wynn had a much more personal stake in the controversial case and realizes his complex puzzle will lead her directly into harm's way in order to find the truth. While Justice Sleeps is a cunningly crafted, sophisticated novel, layered with myriad twists and a vibrant cast of characters. Drawing on her astute inside knowledge of the court and political landscape, Stacey Abrams shows herself to be not only a force for good in politics and voter fairness but also a major new talent in suspense fiction.
